United's success just since 1990 would see them place joint-28th on the most successful clubs table when every other club uses their total trophy haul from their entire histories!

Now, contexualizing their success further and in the grander scheme of all professional sports, I've recently noticed that u/SportsFan591 has been compiling stats on successful teams in different sports. So, having got his/her permission to share their data, you can use the tables to compare United's recent success to all other sports clubs, starting with:

**AMERICAN FOOTBALL -** [https://www.reddit.com/r/FootballAmerica/comments/dfbvnp/nfl\_teams\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FootballAmerica/comments/dfbvnp/nfl_teams_with_the_most_trophies/)

* As you can see, United's success from 1990 onwards comfortably eclipses every American Football teams' historical success. The closest in numbers to United's 43 trophies from this period are the Green Bay Packers with 22 honours.

**CRICKET** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/czi629/domestic\_cricket\_clubs\_with\_the\_most\_trophies\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/czi629/domestic_cricket_clubs_with_the_most_trophies_in/)

* United 1990-2019 beats all but three Cricket clubs in trophies won, with two of those three clubs ahead by only two and six trophies respectively.

**HOCKEY** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/dit8a8/hockey\_teams\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/dit8a8/hockey_teams_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United 1990-2019 would already be the 3rd most decorated hockey club ever, although they'd be some way behind the top two!

**RUGBY UNION** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyunion/comments/dd469a/rugby\_union\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyunion/comments/dd469a/rugby_union_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most/)

* United 1990-2019 would once again be the 3rd (joint 3rd this time) most decorated rugby union club in history, although just like with hockey clubs, they'd be some way off the top two.

**RUGBY LEAGUE** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyleague/comments/dad3a7/rugby\_league\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyleague/comments/dad3a7/rugby_league_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most/)

* United 1990-2019 would see them finish 6th on the list of the most decorated rugby league clubs in history, and just one trophy away from breaking into the top 5!

**BASEBALL** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/d3btcg/baseball\_teams\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/d3btcg/baseball_teams_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United 1990-2019 would finish 4th on a list of the most decorated baseball clubs ever, almost 10 trophies above what's needed to crack the top 5!

**HANDBALL** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Handball/comments/cyrfp1/handball\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Handball/comments/cyrfp1/handball_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United 1990-2019 would finish 10th on a list of the most decorated handball clubs ever, a feat all the more impressive considering that handball is one of the oldest sports historically, with some leagues going back to the beginning of the 20th century.

**AUSSIE RULES** \-  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/d1nn3j/australian\_football\_teams\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/d1nn3j/australian_football_teams_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United 1990-2019 come 3rd on a list of the most successful Aussie Rules teams ever, just five trophies shy of second placed Norwood.

**BANDY** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bandy/comments/d0ow2m/bandy\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bandy/comments/d0ow2m/bandy_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United 1990-2019 would finish 2nd on a list of the most decorated bandy clubs in history, and over 20 trophies ahead of what would be needed to break the top 5.

**PESAPALLO** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Pesapallo/comments/d0lgib/pesapallo\_teams\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pesapallo/comments/d0lgib/pesapallo_teams_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United would comfortably finish ahead of every pesapallo team historically, and by over 25 trophies from the next most successful club.

**WATER POLO** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/waterpolo/comments/cyuof1/water\_polo\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/waterpolo/comments/cyuof1/water_polo_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most/)

* United's lowest ranking position would come amongst water polo clubs, but they'd still manage a top 15 place finish in 14th spot.

United's success in the last 30 years alone would thus already place them in the top 10 of the most decorated clubs ever lists for all but two sports (football itself, where they'd be 28th, and water polo, where they'd be 14th) and the top 5 of all but four sports (football, water polo, handball where they'd be 10th and rugby league where they'd be 6th).

They seem to have decided to never overturn a foul call/no-call and to never use the pitchside monitors.\n\nI actually agree that the monitors shouldn\'t be there.  If you watch MLS the way VAR is implemented, you\'ll see up to 2 minutes burned for the VAR to have a look to tell the CR to wander over to the monitors to make a really clear call in order to sell it all to the fans.  And the fans here in the US really do expect that kind of ceremony.  If there\'s a close call which is correct fans will scream in the post-match thread ""why wasn\'t VAR even used, surely they have to take a look at that"" simply because of butthurt.\n\nBut the PLs interpretation of ""clear an obvious error"" means that since foul calls are subjective, they consider none of those calls to be clear and obvious.  They should drop that bar down so that its just obvious to the neutral that the call should be overturned.  No call will ever be 100%, but if you get it to 90/10 opinion that the call on the field was wrong then it should be overturned.\n\nBut those should be clear enough that the VAR ref can make the call in the booth and the CR pretty much never needs to take a look at the monitors.  I do think the monitors need to go away.  But the PL refs need to sort out the conditions under which they\'ll actually have VAR overturn a foul call on the field.\n\nSo as an MLS viewer I\'ll just say that you don\'t actually want VAR exactly the same way as its used in the rest of the world, and that I can see where the PL is trying to avoid some of the worst bits of VAR.  But it does seem like they\'ve run so far the other direction as to turn it into a joke where its just never used.', 'VAR is fine, but it\'s implementation into the Prem has been a joke. \n\nWhat\'s a clear and obvious mistake? After the Spurs match, I haven\'t a fucking clue. \n\nAnd then the match today, how United didn\'t leave with 3-4 yellow cards I don\'t have any idea. \n\nThere is absolutely no consistency in refereeing. As Charlie Austin so appropriately put it: ""It\'s a joke"".', 'United love it, Liverpool hate it', 'I like it, but the people using it need to up their game.', ""Goal, offside, handball, red cards, penalty claims.  In those instances the VAR official should be God.  No on field decision in those instances should stand, one way or another, without the approval of the VAR official.  It is literally that simple, EPL just needs to stomp out the ego of their officials and make them understand it's not about them, it's about the football teams playing.\n\nRegarding United-Liverpool game, VAR made the right decision to disallow Mane's goal.  New rule states that any contact of the ball via hand is to be called a handball.  There was contact, case closed.  But the Origi one is trickier, which is where the point of this post comes into play.  Criteria.\n\nThe tackle directly lead to a goal and therefore applies in the five instances in which VAR should have the final say.  The criteria Atkinson had during the first half allowed for a more physical game and in that context you could argue that the tackle was on the same level as most, therefore no foul.  If he decided that Origi didn't have control of the ball (the Lukaku touch) when the tackle was made, you could once again argue that there was no foul.  But here's the problem:\n\nOrigi's first touch was poor but he was still on his feet and headed toward the ball.  In other words, he was still in play when the contact on his shin brought him down and United claimed possession.  The play results with United breaking and scoring.  Since that falls in the five instances laid out above, VAR official should be completely removed from the criteria of the on field referee and simply determine if any rule of the game was broken in the goal scoring situation.\n\nCriteria is the issue here.  On field ref can have his, VAR official can have his.  Which takes precedent?  I feel like the ego of EPL refs makes the arbiter on the pitch the king of the hill and they clearly don't like that being taken away.  But if the point of the system is fair arbitration following the rule book, then their ego should be stomped right here, right now.\n\nGoal, offside, handball, red cards, penalty claims.  In these five instances the VAR has the final word, period.  That didn't happen this weekend, especially tonight."", ""We've been hard done by too many times the last seasons for me not to love VAR. Bloody brilliant!"", 'Origi flopped and VAR only helped confirm the flop', ""Feel like there should be a pitch side monitor for the referee. And he should be only referred there for dubious decisions that those in the VAR center (or whatever they call it) don't deem clear and obvious.""]"

36,r/PremierLeague,NotaNoobPat,The Premier League are Hanging Fans Out to Dry and I Don't Feel Enough People Know About It,"I just want to say that I am very appreciative for the amount of Premier League Football I can easily view on TV every weekend. Accessibility to watch football in the UK and abroad is at an all time high. However, it is important to note that individual clubs and the Premier League alike have benefited greatly from this (Monetarily). However, the Premier League are currently screwing fans and I don’t feel like enough people are paying attention.


For those who aren’t familiar, the Premier League releases a fixture list of all the games that will be played during the season but they do not release the times for those matches. They are all listed at 9AM for weekends and 1:45PM for weekday games (American CST). This is only done so TV networks like SkySports, NBC, or Amazon can pick which games they want in prime time to get the highest rating and maximize profits. Typically, the Premier League releases the schedule on time (Friday Release) or on the following Monday at the latest. This time, the schedule for Dec/Jan is nearly a week late (https://www.premierleague.com/news/1242110). It was scheduled to be released on October 11th and there has been no word from the PL about when it will be released. This is apparently due to Amazon Prime gaining the ability to stream some amount of special games in December.


The December and early January schedule are particularly important as there is an influx of domestic and international travel to see clubs. With typical winter breaks, domestic fans are able to arrange travel plans to see their team on Boxing Day (Day after Christmas) where every team plays. For international fans of the Premier League, this is one of the only times they can be guaranteed to see 2 games in 3-4 days in a time that is commonly taken as vacation. This is especially true for Americans who typically receive Christmas Eve (Dec. 24) to the day after New Years (Jan. 2).


With every day that passes, plane, train, and coach tickets becoming increasingly more expensive since demand increases during peak holiday travel. Furthermore, clubs are putting tickets on sale for events that don’t have confirmed dates/times yet. Tottenham has already sold tickets for their highly anticipated match with Chelsea slated for Dec. 21st. Watford will put their tickets up for their match against Man Utd soon if not already. Everton vs. Arsenal tickets is also the same weekend. The following weekend, Arsenal are at home against Chelsea. It is virtually impossible to cheaply plan to see your clubs when you don’t know the days and times. Even worse, people may feel pressure to buy tickets to see a game because they know it will sell out and will just have to pray that the date/time isn’t moved to a spot that they cannot attend.


Fans who are trying to see their clubs are currently being left out to rot and the Premier League has had 0 accountability and given no firm date that the schedule will be confirmed. This is quite frankly unacceptable from what is supposed to be the greatest football league on earth. The schedule needs to be released immediately so fans can adequately plan travel.",self.PremierLeague,Discussion,1571349761.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/dj6toj/the_premier_league_are_hanging_fans_out_to_dry/,/r/PremierLeague/comments/dj6toj/the_premier_league_are_hanging_fans_out_to_dry/,47,165,165,"[""The UK fans always have priority.

Premier league schedule is released before the season starts and like any professional sporting league, fixtures are subject to change.\n\nWe have two domestic cup completions and two European completions that our clubs are involved in. As teams progress through these additional completions the premier league fixtures change with them. It is very rare for games to be moved on short notice and even more unbelievable is the time of KO being moved at short notice. Yes Sky and BT can request for KO times to be moved but this is done weeks if not months in advance. For those of us that travel home and away it has NEVER been an issue. \n\nBefore moaning about a subject you clearly have very little experience in, take a look at LaLiga in Spain. KO times can change on the day of fixture and moan about that.', ""The Christmas fixtures benefit foreigners more than it does domestic fans.\n\nIf you're travelling from abroad to watch Premier league football then from the saturday before Christmas until the 2nd of January each team plays 4 times, you're terrible at planning of you can't attend one of these and if you were coming for football surely you'd stay in London/Manchester/Liverpool since generally speaking these are the most followed teams by foreigners.\n\nWhat it actually fucks up is domestic fans travel plans, rebooking train tickets, having to take days off work, just changing it to studidly inconvinient times that makes it impossible - especially for the away fans.\n\nFuck sky sports, every game should be 3pm Saturday."", 'I’m sympathetic, especially because I’d like to travel to the UK to see my team at least once in my life.  It won’t be a cheap trip and it won’t be anytime soon, so I can only hope things improve for both fans of local teams and larger premier league teams.\n\nSpeaking to the larger issue is the problem of money.  The EPL knows there are dollars to tap into overseas, whether it’s the USA or China or anywhere else.  I can only hope that the league listens to fans and supporters that built the league, i.e. the lifelong fans that attend games each week.  I don’t want to see the league chase money like the NFL and NBA have done in recent years.  After what Bury went through and with the large influx of ‘money laundering’ through team purchases, I hope it spurs more activism to keep things going as they were.  That local love of teams is what drew me to the EPL and it’s what, I suspect, us foreigners find so appealing about it.\n\nIt’s going to be down to all of us consumers to protect the aspects that we value in the league and some of us will miss out on certain things because of it.  If the integrity is lost, I think people will move on to something else if they aren’t listened to.', ""Unfortunately it's a business.

He's tried to fob this off as an injury crisis, but look, this is Manchester fucking Utd... we should have enough players to compete at least, even if there's injuries. Man Shitty are basically missing most of their defense and yet look at them; they've opted for the 'you score 3, we'll score 4' mentality. But as of now, Man Shitty have scored three times the amount of goals as Utd this season... The irony of Utd having a former *striker* who can't get the team to score. You'd honestly think it should be the other way around, that they could score and not defend, and us Utd fans would fucking take that over what's going on now at any rate. \n\nPoch: Not a chance. Levy knows he won't find better in the short term. Also won't pay for it.\n\nBruce: That win over Manure gives a lot of goodwill that'll last up to xmas.\n\nHassenhitler: Not been a good season, but look at the garbage he's working with ffs. Also, remember when he took over last year; he had a lot of work to do after the balls-up Hughes made. Compare this current Saints team to the 2015-16 squad of Pellè, Mane, Tadic, VvD, Wanyama, Fonte, etc. Fuck me, if Hassenhitler has that squad, he'd get in the top 4 now.\n\nFlores: Quite likely. His team's been pish this season. 0 wins, 4 goals scored and 20 conceded in 8 games?!?!?! It's a very weak squad, though. Take out Deeney and Deulofeu and you basically have a poor Championship squad there.\n\nHodgson: Doubt it; he has previous for digging his teams out of a hole. Plus has a lot of goodwill with the supporters. Needs to get them scoring more, though.\n\nFarke: Not a chance. Beating Man Shitty bought serious kudos.\n\nEmery: Doubtful. Arsenal like to keep their garbage close.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy bet: Flores. 2 more bad results and he's gone. Traditionally, 40 points is the token amount to keep you up; Watford have 3 points from 8 games (0.375 PPG); they now have 30 more games to increase this to 1.2333 (recurring) to reach 40 points. That's a big ask and Flores ain't gonna do it. He's gone by November."", 'silva 100%', 'I’m in', ""I feel like it's definitely between Silva and Hasenhuttl.

85,r/PremierLeague,endlessSSSS1,Why Some Big Teams (Ahem ... Man U &amp; Spurs) Get Into Trouble Like This ... 12 Theories!!!,"Thinking through why Man U and Tottenham are having such difficulties so far and here are my early conclusions ...

1. The higher up the table you go, the more chance you are tied into lots of competitions into later rounds which means your players are run ragged and traveling much more and get less recovery time and more injuries AND
2. More of your players are really solid players and therefore are chosen for their national teams and go on international duty so they are not only playing more club team games, but also international games which is tiring with travel and game time and jet lag AND
3. That means the players are sometimes having to learn two different styles of play (club team vs national team) which can be confusing and lead to many errors AND
4. Gaffer is basically forced to play certain players because the club team has invested a king’s ransom in bringing them over ... you actually have less flexibility than other clubs to experiment AND
5. Expectations are very high with the big clubs which means the directors and media and fans often put pressure on their managers very quickly ... the players are not immune either ... prolonged stress usually doesn’t help make things better AND 
6. The opposition may have already been knocked out of FA Cup, Carabao, and never made Champions League or Europa League, etc. They have much more time to prepare for their game with you! AND
7. This cycle goes on season after season so these star players are playing many many many more games than other players. For example Tottenham played 64 games in total in all competitions in 2018-19 and Fulham just 49... which adds up to 1,395 additional minutes of game time in just one season if the average game is 90+3 minutes (in other words about 30% more than others) AND
8.  That means more key players are getting injured because there is more chance of it happening when you are playing much more and you are simply not recovering!!  (simple deduction there) ... major issue for Man City right now AND 
9. You have less time to prepare for each opponent AND
10. Even though you paid through the nose and got a really good player, there are lots of other very very very good players around too who the other PL teams snapped up AND
11.  Not only is the squad very tired so is the gaffer which means he is definitely not as sharp as usual AND
12. You are a target for every team. What opponent doesn’t get a thrill from knocking off a Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham, etc.  The opposing gaffer gets a lot more credit for beating a big club than for taking three points from Watford right now.",self.PremierLeague,Discussion,1570448575.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/dee4em/why_some_big_teams_ahem_man_u_spurs_get_into/,/r/PremierLeague/comments/dee4em/why_some_big_teams_ahem_man_u_spurs_get_into/,4,7,7,"[""Orrr...\n\nMost of United's players are a bit shit."", '1. You get entered in extra competitions, but that\'s not a barometer of how far you\'ll progress in them. This is more of a scheduling problem than a participation problem.\n2. The importance of a good second 11 then, or squad depth. Also, there\'s no more certainty they\'d pick up an injury on international duty than for their club. Also, some foreign players are entered in multiple tournaments (e.g. Africa Cup of Nations,  Euros, Copa America, Confederations Cup etc.) compared to others. This makes it hard to generalise across.\n3. This is an issue (compare Paul Pogba for France vs Paul Jogba for Utd).\n4. This is certainly not as common as you might think. Look at Pulisic at Chelsea; Fat Frank has played him only 5 times in the league and once in the league cup. Also, some players signed can be cup-tied meaning the manager can\'t play them even if he wanted to (e.g. Aubameyang for Gunners). The days of Abramovich impelling Jose to play Shevchenko are long over. \n5. Expectation is high, but fans are realistic. Only one team can win the league each season. Also, it\'s becoming more pertinent now that it\'s not also the *size* of the club that affects this; it\'s also expectations from good performance the season before. Look at Wolves this season; they did great last year and now the fans want and expect more, and rightly so, though Wolves wouldn\'t be considered a *big* club in the traditional sense. \n6. A rehash of point 1. You\'re also assuming homogeneous efficiencies and staff quality to bigger clubs. Small clubs have their own troubles, too. Case in point, constant depredation by bigger clubs creating a lack of cohesion.\n7. Yes, and this is the price of success. Also see my retort to point 2 vis-a-vis squad depth.\n8. You\'re assuming a linear correlation between playing time and potential for injury. There is a far greater number of variables at play than this. This is one of the reasons why big clubs have statisticians and data scientists running MVAs on players. Furthermore, injuries can also be attributed as much to the players as to the training staff; consider Craig Bellamy\'s issues at Man Shitty. Again, variables. I know you said \'simple deduction\', but....\n9. These are teams you face a minimum of twice a season; these are teams with entire teams of scouts and analysts prepping managers and players; this is also assuming other teams face the same travails as your own regarding injuries, multiple competitions, international duty etc.\n10. Squad size is essentially a constant in every league in the world; you can\'t buy all the players (unless you do retarded shit like Chelsea, which doesn\'t pay off).  FFP is also a factor.\n11. EVERY manager is tired; look at them ffs. There\'s no proportional relationship between games played and managerial fatigue. Most of them if not all pretty much work 6/7 day weeks. \n12. *""The opposing gaffer gets a lot more credit for beating a big club than for taking three points from Watford right now.""* Credit, maybe; but most managers value the points more than the illustriousness of taking a scalp. To beat a big club requires risk and the management of risk; only a shit manager would throw caution to the wind to beat a *top 4* team. I\'m not saying it doesn\'t pay off (e.g. Man Shitty vs Norwich) but this is the exception, not the rule.', ""I agree, managers aren't always the problem at a sudden struggling club, players get selfish and big egos need to be controlled and if some players wont capitulate they need to leave they need to understand that they play for the club for the fans, i mean we've seen this with pogba and mourinho last year, 2 big egos clash and the club ends up 2nd best""]"

* This week alone he has played 270 minutes, the full 90 minutes in Wolves games against Watford and Manchester City along with travelling the 4000 mile round trip mid-week to play a full 90 minutes against Besiktas in the Europa League, Wolves won all three games.

97,r/PremierLeague,BerkshireSoxFan,Proportional Premier League Table,"I've often thought that the way points are allocated in football rewards downshifting and not playing to the whistle. So, I've been keeping my own table for the Premier League this season with a points system that, I think, better rewards teams for giving their all for the full 90+ (and punishes teams for falling apart). I don't know if this is something other people have done before but I figured I'd share.  


&amp;nbsp;


4 points are awarded if the goal differential is +3 or more in favor of the team.  
3 points are awarded if the goal differential is +2.  
2 points are awarded if the goal differential is +1.  
1 point is awarded if the goal differential is even.  
-1 points are awarded if the goal differential is -1.  
-2 points are awarded if the goal differential is -2.  
-3 points are awarded if the goal differential is -3 or worse. 


&amp;nbsp;


If two teams are tied on points:  
If the one team has beaten the other, the winner moves ahead.  
If the two teams have drawn or not played eachother, the team with the fewer negative points awarded moves ahead.  
If the two teams are still tied, a die is rolled for each team and the team that rolls a higher number moves ahead.  


&amp;nbsp;


If multiple teams are tied on points:  
The teams are ranked based on the fewest negative points awarded.   
If this still results in a tie, a die is rolled for each team and the team that rolls a higher number moves ahead.
