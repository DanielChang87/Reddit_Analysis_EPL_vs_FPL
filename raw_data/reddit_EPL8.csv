United's success just since 1990 would see them place joint-28th on the most successful clubs table when every other club uses their total trophy haul from their entire histories!

Now, contexualizing their success further and in the grander scheme of all professional sports, I've recently noticed that u/SportsFan591 has been compiling stats on successful teams in different sports. So, having got his/her permission to share their data, you can use the tables to compare United's recent success to all other sports clubs, starting with:

**AMERICAN FOOTBALL -** [https://www.reddit.com/r/FootballAmerica/comments/dfbvnp/nfl\_teams\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FootballAmerica/comments/dfbvnp/nfl_teams_with_the_most_trophies/)

* As you can see, United's success from 1990 onwards comfortably eclipses every American Football teams' historical success. The closest in numbers to United's 43 trophies from this period are the Green Bay Packers with 22 honours.

**CRICKET** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/czi629/domestic\_cricket\_clubs\_with\_the\_most\_trophies\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/czi629/domestic_cricket_clubs_with_the_most_trophies_in/)

* United 1990-2019 beats all but three Cricket clubs in trophies won, with two of those three clubs ahead by only two and six trophies respectively.

**HOCKEY** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/dit8a8/hockey\_teams\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/dit8a8/hockey_teams_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United 1990-2019 would already be the 3rd most decorated hockey club ever, although they'd be some way behind the top two!

**RUGBY UNION** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyunion/comments/dd469a/rugby\_union\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyunion/comments/dd469a/rugby_union_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most/)

* United 1990-2019 would once again be the 3rd (joint 3rd this time) most decorated rugby union club in history, although just like with hockey clubs, they'd be some way off the top two.

**RUGBY LEAGUE** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyleague/comments/dad3a7/rugby\_league\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyleague/comments/dad3a7/rugby_league_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most/)

* United 1990-2019 would see them finish 6th on the list of the most decorated rugby league clubs in history, and just one trophy away from breaking into the top 5!

**BASEBALL** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/d3btcg/baseball\_teams\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/d3btcg/baseball_teams_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United 1990-2019 would finish 4th on a list of the most decorated baseball clubs ever, almost 10 trophies above what's needed to crack the top 5!

**HANDBALL** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Handball/comments/cyrfp1/handball\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Handball/comments/cyrfp1/handball_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United 1990-2019 would finish 10th on a list of the most decorated handball clubs ever, a feat all the more impressive considering that handball is one of the oldest sports historically, with some leagues going back to the beginning of the 20th century.

**AUSSIE RULES** \-  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/d1nn3j/australian\_football\_teams\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/d1nn3j/australian_football_teams_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United 1990-2019 come 3rd on a list of the most successful Aussie Rules teams ever, just five trophies shy of second placed Norwood.

**BANDY** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bandy/comments/d0ow2m/bandy\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bandy/comments/d0ow2m/bandy_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United 1990-2019 would finish 2nd on a list of the most decorated bandy clubs in history, and over 20 trophies ahead of what would be needed to break the top 5.

**PESAPALLO** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Pesapallo/comments/d0lgib/pesapallo\_teams\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pesapallo/comments/d0lgib/pesapallo_teams_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United would comfortably finish ahead of every pesapallo team historically, and by over 25 trophies from the next most successful club.

**WATER POLO** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/waterpolo/comments/cyuof1/water\_polo\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/waterpolo/comments/cyuof1/water_polo_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most/)

* United's lowest ranking position would come amongst water polo clubs, but they'd still manage a top 15 place finish in 14th spot.

United's success in the last 30 years alone would thus already place them in the top 10 of the most decorated clubs ever lists for all but two sports (football itself, where they'd be 28th, and water polo, where they'd be 14th) and the top 5 of all but four sports (football, water polo, handball where they'd be 10th and rugby league where they'd be 6th).

They seem to have decided to never overturn a foul call/no-call and to never use the pitchside monitors.\n\nI actually agree that the monitors shouldn\'t be there.  If you watch MLS the way VAR is implemented, you\'ll see up to 2 minutes burned for the VAR to have a look to tell the CR to wander over to the monitors to make a really clear call in order to sell it all to the fans.  And the fans here in the US really do expect that kind of ceremony.  If there\'s a close call which is correct fans will scream in the post-match thread ""why wasn\'t VAR even used, surely they have to take a look at that"" simply because of butthurt.\n\nBut the PLs interpretation of ""clear an obvious error"" means that since foul calls are subjective, they consider none of those calls to be clear and obvious.  They should drop that bar down so that its just obvious to the neutral that the call should be overturned.  No call will ever be 100%, but if you get it to 90/10 opinion that the call on the field was wrong then it should be overturned.\n\nBut those should be clear enough that the VAR ref can make the call in the booth and the CR pretty much never needs to take a look at the monitors.  I do think the monitors need to go away.  But the PL refs need to sort out the conditions under which they\'ll actually have VAR overturn a foul call on the field.\n\nSo as an MLS viewer I\'ll just say that you don\'t actually want VAR exactly the same way as its used in the rest of the world, and that I can see where the PL is trying to avoid some of the worst bits of VAR.  But it does seem like they\'ve run so far the other direction as to turn it into a joke where its just never used.', 'VAR is fine, but it\'s implementation into the Prem has been a joke. \n\nWhat\'s a clear and obvious mistake? After the Spurs match, I haven\'t a fucking clue. \n\nAnd then the match today, how United didn\'t leave with 3-4 yellow cards I don\'t have any idea. \n\nThere is absolutely no consistency in refereeing. As Charlie Austin so appropriately put it: ""It\'s a joke"".', 'United love it, Liverpool hate it', 'I like it, but the people using it need to up their game.', ""Goal, offside, handball, red cards, penalty claims.  In those instances the VAR official should be God.  No on field decision in those instances should stand, one way or another, without the approval of the VAR official.  It is literally that simple, EPL just needs to stomp out the ego of their officials and make them understand it's not about them, it's about the football teams playing.\n\nRegarding United-Liverpool game, VAR made the right decision to disallow Mane's goal.  New rule states that any contact of the ball via hand is to be called a handball.  There was contact, case closed.  But the Origi one is trickier, which is where the point of this post comes into play.  Criteria.\n\nThe tackle directly lead to a goal and therefore applies in the five instances in which VAR should have the final say.  The criteria Atkinson had during the first half allowed for a more physical game and in that context you could argue that the tackle was on the same level as most, therefore no foul.  If he decided that Origi didn't have control of the ball (the Lukaku touch) when the tackle was made, you could once again argue that there was no foul.  But here's the problem:\n\nOrigi's first touch was poor but he was still on his feet and headed toward the ball.  In other words, he was still in play when the contact on his shin brought him down and United claimed possession.  The play results with United breaking and scoring.  Since that falls in the five instances laid out above, VAR official should be completely removed from the criteria of the on field referee and simply determine if any rule of the game was broken in the goal scoring situation.\n\nCriteria is the issue here.  On field ref can have his, VAR official can have his.  Which takes precedent?  I feel like the ego of EPL refs makes the arbiter on the pitch the king of the hill and they clearly don't like that being taken away.  But if the point of the system is fair arbitration following the rule book, then their ego should be stomped right here, right now.\n\nGoal, offside, handball, red cards, penalty claims.  In these five instances the VAR has the final word, period.  That didn't happen this weekend, especially tonight."", ""We've been hard done by too many times the last seasons for me not to love VAR. Bloody brilliant!"", 'Origi flopped and VAR only helped confirm the flop', ""Feel like there should be a pitch side monitor for the referee. And he should be only referred there for dubious decisions that those in the VAR center (or whatever they call it) don't deem clear and obvious.""]"

36,r/PremierLeague,NotaNoobPat,The Premier League are Hanging Fans Out to Dry and I Don't Feel Enough People Know About It,"I just want to say that I am very appreciative for the amount of Premier League Football I can easily view on TV every weekend. Accessibility to watch football in the UK and abroad is at an all time high. However, it is important to note that individual clubs and the Premier League alike have benefited greatly from this (Monetarily). However, the Premier League are currently screwing fans and I don’t feel like enough people are paying attention.


For those who aren’t familiar, the Premier League releases a fixture list of all the games that will be played during the season but they do not release the times for those matches. They are all listed at 9AM for weekends and 1:45PM for weekday games (American CST). This is only done so TV networks like SkySports, NBC, or Amazon can pick which games they want in prime time to get the highest rating and maximize profits. Typically, the Premier League releases the schedule on time (Friday Release) or on the following Monday at the latest. This time, the schedule for Dec/Jan is nearly a week late (https://www.premierleague.com/news/1242110). It was scheduled to be released on October 11th and there has been no word from the PL about when it will be released. This is apparently due to Amazon Prime gaining the ability to stream some amount of special games in December.


The December and early January schedule are particularly important as there is an influx of domestic and international travel to see clubs. With typical winter breaks, domestic fans are able to arrange travel plans to see their team on Boxing Day (Day after Christmas) where every team plays. For international fans of the Premier League, this is one of the only times they can be guaranteed to see 2 games in 3-4 days in a time that is commonly taken as vacation. This is especially true for Americans who typically receive Christmas Eve (Dec. 24) to the day after New Years (Jan. 2).


With every day that passes, plane, train, and coach tickets becoming increasingly more expensive since demand increases during peak holiday travel. Furthermore, clubs are putting tickets on sale for events that don’t have confirmed dates/times yet. Tottenham has already sold tickets for their highly anticipated match with Chelsea slated for Dec. 21st. Watford will put their tickets up for their match against Man Utd soon if not already. Everton vs. Arsenal tickets is also the same weekend. The following weekend, Arsenal are at home against Chelsea. It is virtually impossible to cheaply plan to see your clubs when you don’t know the days and times. Even worse, people may feel pressure to buy tickets to see a game because they know it will sell out and will just have to pray that the date/time isn’t moved to a spot that they cannot attend.


Fans who are trying to see their clubs are currently being left out to rot and the Premier League has had 0 accountability and given no firm date that the schedule will be confirmed. This is quite frankly unacceptable from what is supposed to be the greatest football league on earth. The schedule needs to be released immediately so fans can adequately plan travel.",self.PremierLeague,Discussion,1571349761.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/dj6toj/the_premier_league_are_hanging_fans_out_to_dry/,/r/PremierLeague/comments/dj6toj/the_premier_league_are_hanging_fans_out_to_dry/,47,165,165,"[""The UK fans always have priority.

Premier league schedule is released before the season starts and like any professional sporting league, fixtures are subject to change.\n\nWe have two domestic cup completions and two European completions that our clubs are involved in. As teams progress through these additional completions the premier league fixtures change with them. It is very rare for games to be moved on short notice and even more unbelievable is the time of KO being moved at short notice. Yes Sky and BT can request for KO times to be moved but this is done weeks if not months in advance. For those of us that travel home and away it has NEVER been an issue. \n\nBefore moaning about a subject you clearly have very little experience in, take a look at LaLiga in Spain. KO times can change on the day of fixture and moan about that.', ""The Christmas fixtures benefit foreigners more than it does domestic fans.\n\nIf you're travelling from abroad to watch Premier league football then from the saturday before Christmas until the 2nd of January each team plays 4 times, you're terrible at planning of you can't attend one of these and if you were coming for football surely you'd stay in London/Manchester/Liverpool since generally speaking these are the most followed teams by foreigners.\n\nWhat it actually fucks up is domestic fans travel plans, rebooking train tickets, having to take days off work, just changing it to studidly inconvinient times that makes it impossible - especially for the away fans.\n\nFuck sky sports, every game should be 3pm Saturday."", 'I’m sympathetic, especially because I’d like to travel to the UK to see my team at least once in my life.  It won’t be a cheap trip and it won’t be anytime soon, so I can only hope things improve for both fans of local teams and larger premier league teams.\n\nSpeaking to the larger issue is the problem of money.  The EPL knows there are dollars to tap into overseas, whether it’s the USA or China or anywhere else.  I can only hope that the league listens to fans and supporters that built the league, i.e. the lifelong fans that attend games each week.  I don’t want to see the league chase money like the NFL and NBA have done in recent years.  After what Bury went through and with the large influx of ‘money laundering’ through team purchases, I hope it spurs more activism to keep things going as they were.  That local love of teams is what drew me to the EPL and it’s what, I suspect, us foreigners find so appealing about it.\n\nIt’s going to be down to all of us consumers to protect the aspects that we value in the league and some of us will miss out on certain things because of it.  If the integrity is lost, I think people will move on to something else if they aren’t listened to.', ""Unfortunately it's a business.

He's tried to fob this off as an injury crisis, but look, this is Manchester fucking Utd... we should have enough players to compete at least, even if there's injuries. Man Shitty are basically missing most of their defense and yet look at them; they've opted for the 'you score 3, we'll score 4' mentality. But as of now, Man Shitty have scored three times the amount of goals as Utd this season... The irony of Utd having a former *striker* who can't get the team to score. You'd honestly think it should be the other way around, that they could score and not defend, and us Utd fans would fucking take that over what's going on now at any rate. \n\nPoch: Not a chance. Levy knows he won't find better in the short term. Also won't pay for it.\n\nBruce: That win over Manure gives a lot of goodwill that'll last up to xmas.\n\nHassenhitler: Not been a good season, but look at the garbage he's working with ffs. Also, remember when he took over last year; he had a lot of work to do after the balls-up Hughes made. Compare this current Saints team to the 2015-16 squad of Pellè, Mane, Tadic, VvD, Wanyama, Fonte, etc. Fuck me, if Hassenhitler has that squad, he'd get in the top 4 now.\n\nFlores: Quite likely. His team's been pish this season. 0 wins, 4 goals scored and 20 conceded in 8 games?!?!?! It's a very weak squad, though. Take out Deeney and Deulofeu and you basically have a poor Championship squad there.\n\nHodgson: Doubt it; he has previous for digging his teams out of a hole. Plus has a lot of goodwill with the supporters. Needs to get them scoring more, though.\n\nFarke: Not a chance. Beating Man Shitty bought serious kudos.\n\nEmery: Doubtful. Arsenal like to keep their garbage close.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy bet: Flores. 2 more bad results and he's gone. Traditionally, 40 points is the token amount to keep you up; Watford have 3 points from 8 games (0.375 PPG); they now have 30 more games to increase this to 1.2333 (recurring) to reach 40 points. That's a big ask and Flores ain't gonna do it. He's gone by November."", 'silva 100%', 'I’m in', ""I feel like it's definitely between Silva and Hasenhuttl.

85,r/PremierLeague,endlessSSSS1,Why Some Big Teams (Ahem ... Man U &amp; Spurs) Get Into Trouble Like This ... 12 Theories!!!,"Thinking through why Man U and Tottenham are having such difficulties so far and here are my early conclusions ...

1. The higher up the table you go, the more chance you are tied into lots of competitions into later rounds which means your players are run ragged and traveling much more and get less recovery time and more injuries AND
2. More of your players are really solid players and therefore are chosen for their national teams and go on international duty so they are not only playing more club team games, but also international games which is tiring with travel and game time and jet lag AND
3. That means the players are sometimes having to learn two different styles of play (club team vs national team) which can be confusing and lead to many errors AND
4. Gaffer is basically forced to play certain players because the club team has invested a king’s ransom in bringing them over ... you actually have less flexibility than other clubs to experiment AND
5. Expectations are very high with the big clubs which means the directors and media and fans often put pressure on their managers very quickly ... the players are not immune either ... prolonged stress usually doesn’t help make things better AND 
6. The opposition may have already been knocked out of FA Cup, Carabao, and never made Champions League or Europa League, etc. They have much more time to prepare for their game with you! AND
7. This cycle goes on season after season so these star players are playing many many many more games than other players. For example Tottenham played 64 games in total in all competitions in 2018-19 and Fulham just 49... which adds up to 1,395 additional minutes of game time in just one season if the average game is 90+3 minutes (in other words about 30% more than others) AND
8.  That means more key players are getting injured because there is more chance of it happening when you are playing much more and you are simply not recovering!!  (simple deduction there) ... major issue for Man City right now AND 
9. You have less time to prepare for each opponent AND
10. Even though you paid through the nose and got a really good player, there are lots of other very very very good players around too who the other PL teams snapped up AND
11.  Not only is the squad very tired so is the gaffer which means he is definitely not as sharp as usual AND
12. You are a target for every team. What opponent doesn’t get a thrill from knocking off a Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham, etc.  The opposing gaffer gets a lot more credit for beating a big club than for taking three points from Watford right now.",self.PremierLeague,Discussion,1570448575.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/dee4em/why_some_big_teams_ahem_man_u_spurs_get_into/,/r/PremierLeague/comments/dee4em/why_some_big_teams_ahem_man_u_spurs_get_into/,4,7,7,"[""Orrr...\n\nMost of United's players are a bit shit."", '1. You get entered in extra competitions, but that\'s not a barometer of how far you\'ll progress in them. This is more of a scheduling problem than a participation problem.\n2. The importance of a good second 11 then, or squad depth. Also, there\'s no more certainty they\'d pick up an injury on international duty than for their club. Also, some foreign players are entered in multiple tournaments (e.g. Africa Cup of Nations,  Euros, Copa America, Confederations Cup etc.) compared to others. This makes it hard to generalise across.\n3. This is an issue (compare Paul Pogba for France vs Paul Jogba for Utd).\n4. This is certainly not as common as you might think. Look at Pulisic at Chelsea; Fat Frank has played him only 5 times in the league and once in the league cup. Also, some players signed can be cup-tied meaning the manager can\'t play them even if he wanted to (e.g. Aubameyang for Gunners). The days of Abramovich impelling Jose to play Shevchenko are long over. \n5. Expectation is high, but fans are realistic. Only one team can win the league each season. Also, it\'s becoming more pertinent now that it\'s not also the *size* of the club that affects this; it\'s also expectations from good performance the season before. Look at Wolves this season; they did great last year and now the fans want and expect more, and rightly so, though Wolves wouldn\'t be considered a *big* club in the traditional sense. \n6. A rehash of point 1. You\'re also assuming homogeneous efficiencies and staff quality to bigger clubs. Small clubs have their own troubles, too. Case in point, constant depredation by bigger clubs creating a lack of cohesion.\n7. Yes, and this is the price of success. Also see my retort to point 2 vis-a-vis squad depth.\n8. You\'re assuming a linear correlation between playing time and potential for injury. There is a far greater number of variables at play than this. This is one of the reasons why big clubs have statisticians and data scientists running MVAs on players. Furthermore, injuries can also be attributed as much to the players as to the training staff; consider Craig Bellamy\'s issues at Man Shitty. Again, variables. I know you said \'simple deduction\', but....\n9. These are teams you face a minimum of twice a season; these are teams with entire teams of scouts and analysts prepping managers and players; this is also assuming other teams face the same travails as your own regarding injuries, multiple competitions, international duty etc.\n10. Squad size is essentially a constant in every league in the world; you can\'t buy all the players (unless you do retarded shit like Chelsea, which doesn\'t pay off).  FFP is also a factor.\n11. EVERY manager is tired; look at them ffs. There\'s no proportional relationship between games played and managerial fatigue. Most of them if not all pretty much work 6/7 day weeks. \n12. *""The opposing gaffer gets a lot more credit for beating a big club than for taking three points from Watford right now.""* Credit, maybe; but most managers value the points more than the illustriousness of taking a scalp. To beat a big club requires risk and the management of risk; only a shit manager would throw caution to the wind to beat a *top 4* team. I\'m not saying it doesn\'t pay off (e.g. Man Shitty vs Norwich) but this is the exception, not the rule.', ""I agree, managers aren't always the problem at a sudden struggling club, players get selfish and big egos need to be controlled and if some players wont capitulate they need to leave they need to understand that they play for the club for the fans, i mean we've seen this with pogba and mourinho last year, 2 big egos clash and the club ends up 2nd best""]"

* This week alone he has played 270 minutes, the full 90 minutes in Wolves games against Watford and Manchester City along with travelling the 4000 mile round trip mid-week to play a full 90 minutes against Besiktas in the Europa League, Wolves won all three games.

So, I've been keeping my own table for the Premier League this season with a points system that, I think, better rewards teams for giving their all for the full 90+ (and punishes teams for falling apart). I don't know if this is something other people have done before but I figured I'd share.  


&amp;nbsp;


4 points are awarded if the goal differential is +3 or more in favor of the team.  
3 points are awarded if the goal differential is +2.  
2 points are awarded if the goal differential is +1.  
1 point is awarded if the goal differential is even.  
-1 points are awarded if the goal differential is -1.  
-2 points are awarded if the goal differential is -2.  
-3 points are awarded if the goal differential is -3 or worse. 


&amp;nbsp;


If two teams are tied on points:  
If the one team has beaten the other, the winner moves ahead.  
If the two teams have drawn or not played eachother, the team with the fewer negative points awarded moves ahead.  
If the two teams are still tied, a die is rolled for each team and the team that rolls a higher number moves ahead.  


&amp;nbsp;


If multiple teams are tied on points:  
The teams are ranked based on the fewest negative points awarded.   
If this still results in a tie, a die is rolled for each team and the team that rolls a higher number moves ahead.

122,r/PremierLeague,slivergao_19x,Leicester hammer 10-man Newcastle,"&gt;[Highlight: Leicester City 5 - 0 Newcastle United](http://www.review24h.online/premier-league/highlight-leicester-city-5-0-newcastle-united-384.html)

“We’re all going on a European tour” sang the Leicester City fans at the King Power Stadium on Sunday, and they could well be right.

https://i.redd.it/oc8alonp3lp31.jpg

Brendan Rodgers’ side won 5-0 against 10-man Newcastle United as they moved up to third in the Premier League table.

Jamie Vardy scored twice, while Ricardo Pereira and Wilfried Ndidi were also on target as Dennis Praet’s effort later went down as a Paul Dummett own goal.

Issac Hayden was shown a straight red card just before half time to make it a tough outing in an even tougher season for Steve Bruce’s Newcastle.

Leicester have 14 points from seven games, while Newcastle have five points.

**3 things we learned**

**1. Leicester ready for the top six**: Fans of the Foxes were singing about Europe on Sunday and you can see why. Rodgers’ young side have so many attacking options, and even without James Maddison they ripped Newcastle apart. They are balanced, defend well, win the midfield battle and have class on the ball to hurt teams in attack. As long as the majority of their squad stays fit, they will be in the top six all season long. The blend between youth and experience is spot on and Leicester, on paper, have players Arsenal, Chelsea and Man United will want. They could finish above those three aforementioned teams this season with Ndidi and Tielemans the unsung heroes in midfield. Next up: Liverpool away. That will be a true test as to how good this team is.

**2. Newcastle in a whole lot of bother**: Just one win from the first seven games of the season doesn’t tell the whole story. Newcastle have been totally devoid of attacking intent in most of their games (Joelinton and Miguel Almiron struggled again) and Steve Bruce has a huge job on his hands to turn this ship around. Despite talk of a new takeover bid led by Peter Kenyon, optimism levels among Newcastle’s fans are not high for this season. The red card didn’t help them at all, but it didn’t alter the likely outcome of this game. Newcastle will be in a relegation scrap all season long and their brilliant fans will have to suffer once again. Next up: Games against Man United and Chelsea. Ouch.

**3. Vardy is having a party**: Vardy has scored 14 goals in 17 Premier League games under Brendan Rodgers and the veteran striker is leading the line superbly. He sets the tone for this squad and with so many young attackers around him, Vardy looks reborn. Rodgers allows him to operate in areas where he’s at his best and the Englishman, now 32, is key to this European push. If he stays fit and in form, Leicester will finish in the top six. If he is injured or runs out of steam, Leicester’s European dream will be in tatters because Rodgers doesn’t have a direct replacement.

**Man of the Match**: Jamie Vardy – Two goals and a constant menace, Vardy gave the Newcastle defense a torrid time. His runs stretch opposition defenses and his finishing is lethal. He will get plenty of service this season and he is allowed to play his natural game. With five goals in his first seven games of the campaign, Vardy is well on track for another 20-goal season in the PL.

Leicester started well as Harvey Barnes cut in from the left and crossed for Perez but the former Newcastle striker saw his instinctive effort saved by Martin Dubravka.

At the other end Newcastle had a few chances on the break and Issac Hayden’s shot across goal could have been diverted goalwards by Yoshinori Muto but the Japanese striker just couldn’t quite sort his feet out.

The Foxes took the lead via a wonderful solo goal as Pereira started the move and then ran almost 30 yards with the ball before rifling home a low shot.

Moments later Leicester’s full back on the other side of the pitch, Ben Chilwell, surged forward and almost scored as Martin Dubravka smothered his effort.

Right on half time Newcastle were reduced to 10 men as Issac Hayden slid in to win a tackle but caught Dennis Praet high with his follow through, and VAR confirmed Hayden was off.

**\[ VIDEO:** [Premier League Highlights](http://www.review24h.online/premier-league/highlight-leicester-city-5-0-newcastle-united-384.html) **\]** 

At the start of the second half Leicester doubled their lead as a long ball played over the top found Barnes who then played in Vardy to slam home at the near post.

Moments later it was 3-0 as Praet was played in on the right and his cross deflected off Paul Dummett and in.

Vardy popped up in the box but missed his kick, while Pereira almost looped in an effort after fine work from sub Marc Albrighton as Newcastle were run ragged in the closing stages of the game.

A lovely cross from Albrighton found Vardy to head home his second and Leiceser’s fourth as the final minutes consisted of Leicester keeping the ball and Newcastle sat deep and hoping for the whistle to blow.

Ndidi scored in the 90th minute to rub extra salt in Newcastle’s wounds as the Foxes flexed their top six credentials.",self.PremierLeague,,1569814491.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/dazzcw/leicester_hammer_10man_newcastle/,/r/PremierLeague/comments/dazzcw/leicester_hammer_10man_newcastle/,0,6,6,

I’ve seen a lot of contradicting posts on various subs about VAR. Some people seem to like that the human error in the game is being checked, others seem to believe that it’s part of the game.

I don’t really have a side, but I can say that refs defaulting to VAR for every questionable play would drive me insane if it were to happen. To mitigate this, I was wondering if there would be a way to make VAR more akin to american football challenges.

A manager would have X (I’m thinking 1-2) amount of VAR challenges in a half/match and they would be able to use them at their discretion. Once they use their VAR challenges they can no longer contest calls made by the refs regardless of whether the call was found to be in favor of the challenge or not.

In certain games, if the ball is shot and bounces back from the keeper or the woodwork and an attacking player scores it, the goal may be disallowed because the second player was offside when the first player shot on goal, but sometimes not. Handballs now don’t take into account the fact that the player touched it intentionally or not, or changed the direction of the ball or not, but there are still referees who will (or not) whistle when the player didn’t even see the ball, or if the attacking player deliberately aims for the defender’s arm.

It works. No one is screaming their heads off in those sports. \n\nIn an attempt to make the game accurate, they have made a mockery of what the game means to the fans. \n\nAdditionally, I have frequently seen the argument for informing the crowd in the stadium about what the VAR referee is seeing. I like the idea. But if the system can be trusted, we do not necessarily need it. Going back to the two sports I mentioned before: in tennis, the trajectory of the ball is shown on the screen. The decision then is pretty unambiguous. In cricket, they DRS is not played on screen (at least in the implementations I have seen). But I wholeheartedly trust the 3rd Umpire to make the right call 99.9% of the time (I give the 0.1% coz of the “too-close-to-call” decisions). In the premier league, this hasn’t been achieved yet. And till the time, us, fans cannot trust the system, I don’t care how right you are, I want to see what the VAR saw. \n\nTL;DR: The referees on the pitch need to grow a pair or just not be on the pitch. Seeing what the VAR sees will surely benefit the fans when the trust in the system isn’t there.', 'Get rid of var', ""I thought about that....but then you're limiting the effectiveness of VAR.

They should have find a quality CAM ( dybala wanted to leave juve, or try to get ericksen from Tottenham) and Winger (maybe should have made a bid for sancho from bvb) but they didn’t. They play an 18 years old from Swansea city which doesn’t really bring anything new to the game.  There’s too many flaws in their squad.

161,r/PremierLeague,Mr_Sam_Alex,We need to talk about VAR...,"Again, gameweek 6 is dominated by talks of VAR. I see arguments popping up saying that millimetres offside shouldn't be offside but i feel this is ridiculous! It is frustrating scoring, only for that goal to be chalked off 30 secs later for something you don't even get a replay of but if you were the opposing team and they didn't give it offside you would be equally annoyed. 

Yes, millimetres is a fraction of an advantage but if we don't give the marginal decisions as offside then where do you draw the line? One week someone will be 2mm offside and it won't be given, the next week they'll be 3mm of side and it will be given. Saying that we shouldn't give marginal decisions only increases the margin for error and will likely cause more controversy.

If anything, maybe we need to look at the offside rule in general, the advantage used to be with the attacker but with the introduction of technology this is long gone. The problem being that due to technology like VAR being available to only a small section of the footballing world, the change would have to be suitable for both high and low level tiers.

I've even toyed with the idea of saying that your only offside if ALL of your body is past the last defender, this would give a massive advantage to strikers but would certainly create more goals.

The fans in the ground don't normally have any idea what is going on, most Premier League grounds don't have big enough screens and it isn't announced over the tannoy or if it is you can barely hear it, it just changes the atmosphere and momentum of the game\n3.

No 'clear and obvious error' or 3mm benefit of doubt. If they can say for sure that a player is offside, then they are offside. If the tech isn't there then don't try and use it. \n\nFor subjective decisions, I think there are 2 options. \n1. No VAR at all for them and leave it to the on field officials.\n2. VAR gets final say but there is a time limit on how long they can take to make a decision (45 seconds or so)\n\nI don't think you can bring 'clear and obvious' into it or give final decision to the ref when VAR has looked at it. VAR have the ability to make a much more informed and certain decision so they should be allowed to use it"", ""Bottom line is this. Do you feel happy when the other team score? No. Do you feel happy when your team scores? Yes. Same thing can be said for Var. Right now I feel like VAR has benefitted the game. At a professional level I'm surprised it hasn't come in sooner to be completely honest. I am one of those people who think offside is offside. Var gets it right everytime. I don't think that's a bad thing and the referees discretion still plays a vital part in the decision making"", ""I think where most people are having a hard time with the millimetres offside bit is that those millimetres weren't calculated by some sort of crazy 3D positioning system with millimetre accuracy but instead are part of a system that involves someone drawing lines on a picture. \n\nSomeone else may well have drawn the lines slightly differently, or even used a different frame on which to draw the lines. That could have resulted in the player being onside, or maybe even more offside.\n\nSo really I think some people are saying the technology isn't accurate enough to give a correct measurement within some range (margin of error), so if the result of VAR is within that range you can't rely on it and should probably go with the initial call.\n\nAs a spurs fan the called sucked of course, but it wasn't the reason we lost that match. After it was overturned it was still 1-0, we just couldn't close out the game (again...)\n\nEdit: I just realized after posting this message that my example was more an example of the system being imprecise rather than inaccurate at a small scale, though really it seems to be both.""]"

The implementation of it, is.","Var is a system that was brought into the league to correct blatant mistakes or missed calls by referees which in theory is a good thing. What the league is doing with it is ruining the game. Counting millimeters to determine whether or not the attacker is offside is absolutely absurd. This is obviously a reaction to Aurier’s disallowed goal against Leicester today. In the early first half there was a goal disallowed scored by Ayoze Perez who was obviously offside when the initial shot was taken, and in my opinion was the right call and the correct way var should be used. In the early second half Son was called offside after var determined that his shoulder was millimeters in front of the defender’s. Aurier’s goal would have taken Tottenham up 2-0 and seemingly winning them the game. Instead the goal was disallowed and Leicester, who played great today and it’s shame that var is talking point of the game, has all of the momentum and go on to win the game. The technology that the Premier League is using is not even advanced enough to determine where Son’s shoulder precisely is. They way they decide the player’s shoulder is by dragging a line to where they think it is and thinking “hey that’s close enough” but if they want to begin to count in precision the millimeters to determine whether or not a player is onside then they should have the proper technology that can precisely determine where the attacker’s shoulder is. Without that sort of technology it leaves these very very close calls to human error, and var was implemented to negate human error not open another door for it.

RB- Trent Alexander Arnold- The full back had a good game against Burnley with 2 tackles, 3 blocks, 5 recoveries and 3 key passes as some of his standout stats. His attempted cross took a deflection of Chris Wood and went in which helped Liverpool win 3-0.

CB- Jannik Vestegaard- The Saints weren't the favourites coming into this match, but Jannik had a great defensive performance with 5 interceptions, 4 clearances and made it difficult for United to get good chances. He earned the Saints a point with a towering header over Lindelof for his first goal in English football

CB- Virgil Van Dijk- It was a great week for Virgil. He won the UEFA Defender of the year and more importantly the UEFA player of the year over Messi and Ronaldo and becoming the first defender to win the award. Then Virgil got back on the pitch and it was business as usual with 11 clearances and 12/14 aerial duals won.

RM- Richarlison- He has had a bit of a slow start to the season, but on Sunday he sparked into life with 2 goals vs Wolves in what was a exhilarating game which ended in a 3-2 win for the Toffees

CM- Kevin De Bruyne- What a start its been for De Bruyne to this season. He has been the brightest spark in City's midfield and the game at the Etihad was no different as he registered another assist along with his first goal of the season goal and was key to City team that ran riot over Brighton. De Bruyne is back to his absolute best after what was a difficult season and has proved himself the best playmaker in the league with 5 assists and 16 key passes, leading in both stats.

CM- Matteo Guendouzi- Big game for Arsenal but the 20 year old showed no fear and was (in my opinion) Arsenal's best player. He was always looking to get the ball forward which is shown by his 83% pass rate and 2 key passes, with one being a world class cross to assist Aubameyang for the equaliser. He was also very good on defense, winning 3 tackles and making to interceptions. His amazing performance was almost capped off with a goal which would've put the icing on the cake, but was denied by Lloris.

LM- Callum Robinson- The Blades were underdogs going to Stamford Bridge and found themselves 2-0 down at half-time and something had to change, and something did. As soon as the second half started the Blades were away and Robinson scored a well taken goal and continued to have a good game threatening Chelsea a lot having 3 other shots, 2 inside the box, and eventually assisted the equaliser to Zouma for an own goal to salvage a point for the Blades.

ST- Jamie Vardy- Scoring worldies, deadly runs in behind, aggressive closing down, this very much looked like the Jamie Vardy of 2015-16. Brendan Rodgers has breathed new life into this man as he has scored 12 goals in the14 games Rodgers has taken charge of at Leicester. Vardy opened his account with an absolutely sensational chip over the keeper. He later went on to get an assist and another goal to cap off an amazing game

ST- Sergio Aguero- A regular on the Man city scoresheet. Augero showed us once again why he is one of the greatest forwards in the world with 2 magnificent finishes as he dazzled the fans in attendance and gave the Brighton players a torrid time.

241,r/PremierLeague,ncrooks11,3 Words to Sum-Up the Top Six after GW 4,"**Manchester City - Clinical and Rolling -** Birghton &amp; Hove Albion have shown the rest of the Premier League exactly how NOT to play against City. City absolutely pulled apart BHA's attacking style of play and was able to create space and finish their opportunities with great accuracy. Aguero is hitting his stride and Kevin De Bruyne has come roaring back from injury. City's next five fixtures are all winnable, with only Everton away that looks somewhat competitive. City will look to stay on pace with Liverpool and further separate themselves from the rest of the Premier League.

**Liverpool - Finally a Shutout -** Liverpool have finally managed to tally their first clean sheet of the 2019-20 Premier League season against a Burnley side with an inform Ashley Barnes up top. Adrian made a few great saves to keep the clean sheet intact and the rampant attack of Liverpool did their job expertly. A few people will look to much into Sadio Mane's tantrum when coming off the pitch, but this just shows how much of a competitor he is. Liverpool have Leicester, Chelsea, and Manchester United in their next 5 games and will need solid defensive performances to keep pace with City.

**Tottenham - Lack of Composure -** Looking for a rare win away at the Emirates, Tottenham was 2-0 up with only 5 minutes to go until half-time. A scrappy goal from Lacazette followed from what was some perplexing defensive decision making by Danny Rose, sent Spurs into the half-time break up 2-1. All momentum was lost after that and Arsenal came out with serious pressure in the second half. After conceding the equalizer to Aubameyang, Spurs almost lost the game on three consecutive goals until what would be the game winner from Sokratis was deemed offside by VAR. Tottenham also had their own chances to win the game late, Sissoko skewed his opportunity and Kane had a penalty shout that was unanswered by Martin Atkinson. 

**Manchester United - How Much Longer? -** An absolute stunner of a goal from Daniel James gave United the lead at St. Mary's after just 10 minutes. After that though, United looked devoid of any attacking threat and eventually gave up the equalizer in the 58th minute to Jannik Vestergaard. This 1-1 result begs the question, how much longer will this go on for United? With one win in four games played, what changes have to be made to get this team to score more goals? Outside of their dominating performance against Chelsea, they've only managed 1 goal in each of their last three games. Time to move Pogba further forward and give him a free role? Man United fans, let me know what needs to change in the comments!

**Arsenal - Well Fought Match -** After going 2-0 down to Tottenham at home, Arsenal fought back well and put tremendous pressure on Spurs in the second half. The front three of Lacazette, Pepe, and Aubameyang look frightening and will win games by themselves this season. Until the substitution to bring on Ceballos for Torreira, the Arsenal midfield looked invisible and was often bypassed by the Tottenham attack. Granit Xhaka had an absolute blinder of a performance and gunners had to be shaking their heads in dismay when he gave the penalty away for Spurs second goal. All in all it was an average performance from Arsenal with good attacking play in some stages but the defensive errors cost them all three points. 

**Chelsea - International Break Welcome -** After two goals from Tammy Abraham in the first have and a 2-0 score at half-time all Chelsea had to do was manage the game and see out the second half. Sheffield United had other ideas and through Callum Robinson and an own goal by Kurt Zouma, the blades were able to steal a point at Stamford Bridge. The international break seems to be coming at a perfect time for Chelsea if they can get N'golo Kante and Antonio Rudiger back on the pitch. It may be time to give youngster, Reece James some playing time ahead of Azpilicueta who has looked poor early in this season. At least Chelsea fans will be happy that they have found their nailed on starter at the forward position in Tammy Abraham.

He simply went for another challenge he couldn’t win and left a big hole in the middle of our defence of which spurs capitalised on.

That said, the Grealish incident yesterday was an absolute abomination and even if the ref was relying on VAR he should have played on and then called it back for a VAR check.

There\'s so many problems that fix one thing but make create another problem. Or don\'t make sense. Or you don\'t know what the VAR are basing their decision on. I can think of a few problems just this week! Firstly, if we are going to have VAR, we may as well use it for dives and tell the refs not to EVER blow for dives so mistakes like the one against Aston Villa this week don\'t happen. Second, the VAR refs have gone over the top with the interpretation of ""clear and obvious"" mistake. There was a CLEAR pen on Haller in the West Ham vs Crystal Palace game and they reviewed it and didn\'t give it. I have no idea why they didn\'t but I assume it wasn\'t ""clear and obvious"" enough. Absolute grongos. the guy slid in, missed the ball and took out his knee. They need to scrap the clear and obvious thing for sure and just make a new decision everytime VAR is involved. Nothing is worse than watching VAR have a look at something and then the decision being ""yeah um we are not sure just go with what the ref said"" or ""it\'s not enough of an obvious error"".  Just make a new and final decision you weak dogs. Don\'t even get me started on handballs my god. or the offside ""if it\'s close just let em run"" rule. Rashford was pretty obviously offside from a long ball this week and they let him run then he won a corner.

Personally, a fan of  American Football and Baseball, I think that replays take away from the human element of referees. An umpire in baseball will often get a close call wrong because that's all he can determine. And an NFL referee uses his best judgement on when and when not to throw a flag on a play. You're not going to get every call going your way and the video referee corrupts that idea that humans have to make the on field judgement. Not to mention it slows down the game way too much.""]"

The referee today was abysmal. Palace 100% deserved the 3 points, they were the better team.  But I’m assuming that you’ve all seen what happened in the last minute.

Grealish sprints with the ball towards the box and at the VERY worst, falls over. He doesn’t look towards the ref, he doesn’t shout, he even managed to offload the ball to Lansbury before falling over. Lansbury then scores but the ref disallows it and gives Grealish a yellow for diving.

Who do you think will get that position? Personally I’m going West Ham being a hammer myself, but here is an opinion on the big 4 destined to fight for that spot.

Everton - quality side, always making some big signings but can never seem to get it together. Andre Gomes dropped an awful performance against Villa, and Pickford has shown to be a liability at times.

Wolves - A tough unit and turn up against the big teams, but squad depth will be a problem this season; they are going to stay in Europa for longer as they cannot guarantee when they will be in the competition again so they might aswell go for it!

Leicester - Arguably the best midfield outside of the top 6, plus Vardy banging them in are a real threat. However they may struggle since losing Maguire.

West Ham - Have a lot of quality players in Lanzini, Haller and Rice etc, but the midfield is often left exposed and the defence is often not in sync.",self.PremierLeague,Discussion,1567207832.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/cxii67/who_gets_7th_place_this_season/,/r/PremierLeague/comments/cxii67/who_gets_7th_place_this_season/,24,3,3,"['Manchester United', 'I’m going Leicester because Everton don’t seem good enough so far this season, West Ham have a defensive problem and wolves have Europa League which will be prioritised', 'Sorry I’m just throwing this but (Not a fan of any of the top clubs) \n\n1st- Man City / Liverpool \n2nd - Liverpool / Man City \n3rd- Arsenal \n4th- Spurs \n5th - Wolves / Leicester \n6th- Leicester / Wolves\n7th- Everton / West Ham \n8th- Manchester United \n9th - Chelsea', 'Chelsea 100%', 'How about Watford?']"
270,r/PremierLeague,huamanticacacaca,The Internet Predicts The Premier League,"Before the start of the season I invited Redditors and members of a few forums to predict the final 2019/20 Premier League table. Everyone was asked to submit their individual responses and the average position for each team would be calculated. This final calculated table would be viewed as what the internet predicts the final table will look like.    
    
All of the predictions were submitted before a ball was even kicked, and submissions were closed just minutes before kick-off of the first game of the season, when Liverpool beat Norwich 4-1 on Friday 9th August.    

Well the time has come to post the results, albeit a little later than originally planned.  I’ll post the full table below but I thought I’d do a quick summary of what the internet expects of the coming season.    
    
Man City will win the league.    
Liverpool, Tottenham and Arsenal will all quality for next seasons’ Champions League.    
Man United and Chelsea will finish off the top six.    
Bad news for Sheffield United who will finish bottom of the league.    
Norwich and Newcastle will be the other two teams relegated.    
The other newly-promoted team, Aston Villa, will survive the drop and finish 16th.
    
As for the table, I’ve also included the overall “score” for each team, which reflects where they were ranked for all 720 submissions. The easiest way to understand the point scoring being used is that the team ranked in first on an individual table was awarded 20 points, with the team in second being awarded 19 points, 3rd getting 18, and so on until the team ranked 20th was awarded just 1 point. Add up all the points earned by all twenty teams, according to all 720 entries, and we’re left with an overall score. This is how the final positions have been calculated.    
    
Position | Team | Score
:--: | :-- | :--:
01 | Man City | 14025
02 | Liverpool | 13654
03 | Tottenham | 12547
04 | Arsenal | 11576
05 | Man Utd | 11444
06 | Chelsea | 11033
07 | Leicester | 9365
08 | Everton | 9104
09 | Wolves | 8711
10 | West Ham | 7225
11 | Watford | 6690
12 | Bournemouth | 6268
13 | Crystal Palace | 5189
14 | Southampton | 4887
15 | Burnley | 4603
16 | Aston Villa | 3754
17 | Brighton | 2778
18 | Newcastle | 2520
19 | Norwich | 2494
20 | Sheffield Utd | 1863
    
Throughout the season I’ll post updates on how the predicted table is performing compared to the actual table, if people are interested.

290,r/PremierLeague,ncrooks11,3 Words to Sum-Up the Top Six after GW 3,"**Manchester City - New Win Streak -** After stumbling at home to Tottenham last weekend (much thanks to VAR), City are back to their winning ways behind two goals from Sergio Aguero. With a favorable schedule through much of September and October, they will look to reclaim and surpass their past winning streak. 

**Liverpool - Perfect on Top -** This Liverpool squad is on a mission to prove that they are the Premier League favorites, City be damned. Right now, I would not want to be in the shoes of any opposition that stands in front of them, but the Liverpool faithful will still question why this team cannot keep a clean sheet after allowing Arsenal to score in the 85th minute. 

**Tottenham - Not Good Enough -** Spurs have won only 4 games in their last 15 in the Premier League and there are a lot of questions being asked of the North London club. What is going on with Jan Vertonghen? Is Eriksen leaving or staying? Why can this team not keep a clean sheet? Next weekend is the North London Derby and could be a pivotal moment in how Tottenham's season plays out. 

**Manchester United - Ole's Seat Warming? -** When Daniel James scored for United in the 89th minute the momentum looked to have shifted in their favor and you could sense they could possibly score a second and win the game. Crystal Palace and Patrick Van Aanholt had a different idea. United have won just 3 of their last 15 games under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and his seat seems to be heating up at Old Trafford. Also, can anyone score a penalty for United? 

**Chelsea - Lampard's First Win -** Chelsea's first win of the season comes off the back of a Tammy Abraham brace and Frank Lampard will be happy to see his first win as manager. What Lampard won't be happy about is that his defense looks in disarray without N'Golo Kante in the squad. His fitness is crucial to Chelsea's Premier League and Champions League push! 

**Arsenal - Defense Still Lacking -** Arsenal fans thought that their issues at the back had been solved when they brought in David Luiz, or at least they had hoped they had been solved. As it looks after the Liverpool defeat, Luiz is a like for like replacement for Shkodran Mustafi. Although not entirely at fault for their defensive woes, Luiz did not do himself any favors. He needlessly tugged Salah's jersey leading to the penalty and then jumped out of the way of Salah, as Luiz was on a yellow, during his run for the third goal.

Man City - Seattle Seahawks, A team who no one took seriously before but then money &amp; elite players came &amp; they became one of the best in the league. 



Liverpool - San Francisco 49ers, Lots of history &amp; titles but have lacked recent success. Had some of the best players in history &amp; a very big fanbase. 



Spurs - New York Jets, The annoying team who no one likes from the big city who always are misfiring screwups. 



Aston Villa - Cincinati Bengals, Pessimistic team from the middle of the country who haven't really done a whole lot but are always kinda there. 



Newcastle United - Chicago Bears, Unlucky team from up north who are dysfunctional but have really passionate fans. 


Chelsea - New England Patriots, Great teams who got blessed with good owners &amp; great coaches &amp; players for the past two decades &amp; have never stopped winning. Really awful fans.

I think that's open to interpretation. I have seen players running backwards, lose their footing and trip over a player and penalised them because it's on them to keep their footing. Likewise, if a player runs at an opponent in muddy conditions, can't stop and loses their footing - that's on them. Sometimes things happen. Take a stride funny and it puts pressure on your knee and you can't maintain your balance, things like that. Is that what happened here? If so, does that constitute careless? I honestly can't decide on what the right decision is here, I think it's a tough one - and being so ambiguous, VAR can't do much either way. Of course if you don't give the defender the benefit of the doubt then you're saying this was somehow intentional - I couldn't really argue that, but now we have a RC-DOGSO scenario."", 'It felt like Kane didn’t seek the ball, but the player who fell.

Both Chelsea and United have 4 points, but for some reason United and Solskjaer are getting hated and Chelsea is being praised as if they had 9 points. I watched all 3 United games (Yes, I am a United fan, but I am really critical) and they played really well, and had controll of the game against wolves and against crystal, ofc there were some bad aspects of United's game, e.g Lingard and effectiveness, but they don't deserve so much hate. Their game looks much better than last season and they just lack a bit of luck. If Pogba and Rashford scored penalties, I am sure United would have 7 or 9 points.

306,r/PremierLeague,satandimaria,This will a long season for us Man Utd fans,"Watching Liverpool v Arsenal right after our defeat has made realise how poorly coached we are. When you see how well drilled Liverpool are in attack when compared to us playing headless chickens against Palace at home it shows Ole is very out of his depth when next to Klopp, Poch, Pep and even Nuno.

When you watch not just Liverpool but also City and Spurs you see a structure and pattern in their  attacking phase. Players know what pass to make, players in spaces to find, movement, quick releases etc. It is very coordinated and then you see us and deary me it's a disaster. We have players not knowing their roles with lack of movement which causes our players to dwindle on the ball for too long therefore inevitably loosing possesion as you can see in Palace's winning goal.

It not just Palace we look clueless against. We also look clueless against Cardiff, Huddersfield, Wolves or any team that sit back and hit us on the counter due to our sterlie gameplan.

To able to break down teams sitting deep require top coaching and tactical understanding which I fear Ole lacks. We are amazing when there are spaces in the pitch abd hit on the counter as we are very quick but there is no spaces to run free then we look literally like a Championship team. I fear that's how most clubs we face in the league will set up so this will make another bleak autumn until it get desperate enough for the board to fire him and find a manager who offer more than just **PASHUN AND SPRWIT** and able to figure out Lingard should not be our starting 10!",self.PremierLeague,Discussion,1566757888.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/cv6y5u/this_will_a_long_season_for_us_man_utd_fans/,/r/PremierLeague/comments/cv6y5u/this_will_a_long_season_for_us_man_utd_fans/,11,8,8,"['I was already very skeptical when Ole decided to drop Lukaku forever when he was one of the best forwards in the PL.

316,r/PremierLeague,ItsbeenBroughton,Persistent fouling as a tactic.,"After watching the Manchester United vs Crystal Palace game and analyzing the stats I found an interesting trend that’s worth a thought and a discussion by fans: Persistent fouling as a tactic. 

I want to compare two teams, one who has been regularly winning and being cited as using fouling as a tactic to break up all opposition attacks (Manchester City) and Another that deployed the tactic today to great advantage and frustration, (Crystal Palace).

City  Vs  Spurs         
Fouls 14  vs 4     
Yellow Cards  1 vs 0

CP   Vs  MU        
Fouls  18  vs 8        
Yellow Cards  4 vs 2


Both teams that deployed this tactic were rewarded, granted City did not win, but they did take away a point against a well organized Spurs. I think this discussion is warranted because I feel that the Match officials are allowing too many fouls to happen which dampens the game and not enough cards are given to restrict this tactic. I haven’t looked into individual stats but I am fairly confident that the central midfielders will probably all register 3-4 fouls each which should warrant a card itself based off the persistent fouling rule, but commonly is not given until the 60th minute or not at all. 

What are your thoughts on the tactic, the referee involvement (or lack thereof) or the impact it has for the fan on the game?",self.PremierLeague,Discussion,1566694247.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/cuvt87/persistent_fouling_as_a_tactic/,/r/PremierLeague/comments/cuvt87/persistent_fouling_as_a_tactic/,10,5,5,"[""The prem is a physical league. Over the last 5-10years professional fouls like shirt pulling and trips from behind when a break is on etc have been more strictly dealt with (guaranteed yellow) which is great.

If niggly fouls were treated harsher we'd lose some of that which would be a real shame."", ""Football has a big culture of no accountability or personal responsibility.  Everything is always the ref's fault.  The players weren't badly behaved - the ref lost control of the match.  The player didn't make a bad tackle - the ref ruined the game.  The player didn't deserve a card - the ref was overzealous and didn't understand the game.  Or the ref doesn't give the card and he's lacking courage.  \nDon't blow the whistle until players go down?  Wrong approach.  Blow the whistle when there's a foul affecting the player but they stay on their feet?  Wrong approach.  \nNow, any other sport in the world would just expect the referees to enforce the laws and be done with it.  Football, with all that and commercial pressures, the referees get hamstrung.  They're basically not allowed to do anything about the constant abuse, dissent, mobbing ('it's just an emotional game', the referees need to 'manage' the players, all that nonsense...oh, and the best one, 'referees need to understand that people have bought tickets to see those players, not to see them get sent off').  Everything about the way the game is refereed is pandering to all of this.  And honestly, I think most of our complaints about refereeing largely stem from this approach.  Look at keepers handling the ball - the law says 6 seconds, but 20 seconds is normal - with up to 30 being seen.  Yet, referees are discouraged from applying the law.  Imagine how much faster the game would be if they enforced 6 seconds.  But rather than applying the laws, they don't because people apparently don't want to see them 'making it all about them' or some nonsense.\nWhat am I getting at?  Referees virtually never card for a lot of things, and persistent infringement is fast becoming this.  When referees at all levels are copping absolute incredible amounts of abuse (which no other sport tolerates), it discourages referees from some decisions.  When I started, we were taught that 3 fouls is a rough figure for PI, depending on frequency and severity.  After a while, it would become more like 5ish....again, depends - just because it becomes harder and harder to apply it.  And when I started, we had a lot of great videos of top-tier refs applying a PI caution after 3 fouls.  These days?  You pretty much never see them given."", 'I think when a player grabs another from behind to deliberately stop an attack it should be a red card.

331,r/PremierLeague,PTwno,Is Man City really not an honourable club as everyone claims?,"If Man Utd, as I find them to be the appropriate comparison by many obvious reasons, had a financial management as good as Man City's they would probably be the ones up there holding consecutive Premier League titles.

The amounts spent by them the last few years (Pogba breaking the record of most expensive player back then and now Maguire as the most expensive defender ever, betweem others), demonstrate that they do have the financial resources just as much as City.

You can tell me ""Oh but City has spent a larger total the last few years compared to United!"", sure they have. But if Man Utd had the same success as City maybe they would spend a lot more as well. They would have more money for being sucfessful! Maybe Cristiano Ronaldo would have come back to them instead of off to Juventus. Maybe Guardiola would be a red devil by now instead of on the blue side of the city...

I truely believe, and I might be wrong about this, that Man City don't even need the arab money from their owner anymore. They are now making enough to be self sustaining year after year with the increased TV revenue in the Premier League and sports prizes and sponsors higher than ever.

The main difference between these two clubs is the way they got to being a top club. United was through winning trophies all over for years and through many decades of being a top club in England before there were these stupidly large sums of money envolved. City, on the other hand, were bought by a tycoon who invested hundreds of millions in them. HOWEVER though, this money was very well spent. The club was well managed for years all the way up to the top.

City's most expensive player ever was Sterling for around 80M, I believe. He is currently smashing every opponent and arguably the best Prem winger. United just a few years ago spent that in Di Maria. Alexis Sanchez has a stupid amount for weekly wages. Both great players but what have they brought to the club? Lukaku started his United career extremely well with I believe it was 11 goals in 10 matches, however he ended up being sold for less than the price paid to sign him in the first place. 

I bet that City, with all their tycoon money and United's club management, after Sir Alex left, would now still be an average Premier League club. And United could be better every year with City's management!

With all that said, I really hope that United come back to being a top top club in Europe very soon because of their history and all they've brought to us football fans not too long ago.",self.PremierLeague,Discussion,1566620603.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/cujdci/is_man_city_really_not_an_honourable_club_as/,/r/PremierLeague/comments/cujdci/is_man_city_really_not_an_honourable_club_as/,4,1,1,"[""Food for thought...man city are owned by a ruling royal family and the deputy prime minister of a country.

**Worst no call --**

\-Yerry Mina [taking down Deolufeu](https://youtu.be/9iuqKw5iYW4?t=287) in the box. Contact from behind, for me it was enough to at least warrant a reveiw.

&amp;#x200B;

**Voldermort award --**

\-[Jonjo Shelvey](https://youtu.be/2LGsX6jBRW8?t=410) for obvious reasons

&amp;#x200B;

**Best Revenge Award --**

\-VAR on Gabriel Jesus [(knocking down booth)](https://twitter.com/TrollFootball/status/1162811781489709056?s=20)

&amp;#x200B;

**Most Overrated after 1 game played award --**

\-Dani Ceballos. Yes he had 2 assists, the first was a bad corner that Lacazette had to take 3 touches before shooting and the second was a normal midfield steal/pass to Auba who did all the work

&amp;#x200B;

**The Bend Me award --**

\-Ben Mee for [getting bent by Pepe](https://youtu.be/nXnIj-CehOc)

&amp;#x200B;

**The “Fool me twice, shame on me” award --**

&amp;#x200B;

**The “Least intimidating name, most lethal striker” award --**

\-Teemu Pukki. Pukki sounds like the name a child would name their favorite blanket that they hold when scared, but [his volley against newcastle](https://youtu.be/2LGsX6jBRW8?t=157) will be giving Dubravka nightmares for a week.

\-Villa’s Douglas Luiz, who let the[ ball roll through his legs for a step over](https://youtu.be/mWk1KqxjSJ4?t=46), but with no teammates behind him, and Harry Wilson fired it home from long range.

341,r/PremierLeague,Illustrious_pogboom,My team of the week after matchweek 2,"GK- Hugo Lloris- Despite not keeping a clean sheet, Tottenham could have lost the game if not for Lloris who chipped in with 8 saves to deny City all 3 points

RB- Ricardo Pereira- The full back had a great game vs Chelsea and helped out a lot defensively with 8 tackles and 3 interceptions. He also completed 5/7 dribbles.Ricardo has been great at both ends of the court by being 2nd in tackles made and 1st in successful dribbles

CB- Jack O'Connell- The Blades defended really well against Crystal Palace, and part of that was Jack who saw off the aerial threat of Benteke and the flair of Zaha who between them had 2/6 of Palace's attempts on goal. He also had the most clearances in the game with 11

CB- Caglar Soyuncu- It look like Leicester would struggle defensively after not getting a good replacement for Maguire, however Soyuncu has proved us wrong by last week keeping Jimenez quiet, and this week he kept Giroud and Abraham quiet. He showed that he wasn't afraid of a physical battle.

LB- Lucas Digne- The Barcelona reject has been sensational since joining Everton. His link-up play with Bernard is very good and he showed this with a wonderful pass from his own area to set up the only goal of the day. The frenchman also had 3/4 tackles.

CM- Kevin De Bruyne- He spent majority of last season on the sidelines, but in only the second match this season De Bruyne showed us what a world class player he is with 2 outstanding assists and an overall 9 key passes which is as many as West Ham and Crystal Palace have managed this season.

CM- Dani Cabellos- The Spaniard had an immediate impact on his debut at the Emirates by assisting both of Arsenal's goals and added some flair to the team with 4 dribbles completed. The midfielder looked really positive and was always looking to go forward.

CM- Ruben Neves- Ruben Neves only scores worldies? that was defiantly the case here as he scored one of those against Man United to secure a point for Wolves. Neves also had a passing rate of 89% a 100% tackle rate and 2 interceptions.

RW- James Maddison- They were lacking creativity in the first half only getting off 1 shot. In the second half Maddison took control and was simply outstanding showing excellent energy and creativity in helping Leicester register 11 shots in the second half, even assisting Ndidi in the equaliser. James had the joint most key passes in the game with 3 and completed 2 dribbles

LW- Sadio Mane- Mane opened the scoring with a banger against his former team, but other than that the winger showed excellent playmaking ability with an assist to Firmino to lead to the 2nd goal of the game and with four other key passes in the game 

ST- Teemu Pukki- The Finnish striker has had an amazing start to his Premier league career and has a strong claim for the Player of the month award. He scored a hat-trick with the first goal being an absolutlty stunning volley, as Norwich condemned Newcastle to their second defeat out of 2 games",self.PremierLeague,Highlights,1566539744.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/cu4c7k/my_team_of_the_week_after_matchweek_2/,/r/PremierLeague/comments/cu4c7k/my_team_of_the_week_after_matchweek_2/,22,147,147,"['No complaints here', 'this is really good, and I feel Soyuncu doesn’t get enough attention for how important his aggression is to the leicester back line, happy you’ve put him in there.', 'Both ends of the court?', 'Well picked 11, wasn’t expecting to see 1 let alone 2 players from promoted sides play this well this early on but they deserved to be recognized', 'absolutely spot on mate', 'Yeah spot on TOTW', 'Yeah agree', 'Solid selections', 'lundstram?']"

Guardiola is probably the most interesting case though. After his time at Barcelona he moved to Brescia. He failed a drug test  then was banned from football for four months and on appeal in 2005, Guardiola was actually handed a seven-month suspended jail sentence by a court in Brescia.  However in 2007 he was exonerated.\n\nThere remains some suspicion around Pep, I believe that he is a top manager and this is more heresay/ mild links but some do believe that he may have used unorthodox healing methodologies at Barcelona and his other clubs too. One thing that many people cite is that at Barcelona Guardiola hired the doctor who had overseen him at Brescia,  Ramon Segura, and who had supplied him with [""tainted"" supplements](http://www.sportingintelligence.com/2017/04/25/sharapova-guardiola-doping-darkness-and-light-250401/), which were blamed for his ban.  Also in 2010 UEFA fined Barcelona €30,000 for failing to provide their players’ locations so that when officials came to take samples, the players were not present to be tested. This is something that happened at Manchester City under Guardiola, the team were found to have broken anti-doping regulations [3 times in 5 months](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39383967).\n\nWhat is interesting, from a footballing perspective, is the whole doping situation as it seems so unlikely no one is cheating. Like you have rightly said in your synopsis it is rare players are found to be cheating. This lack of doping is partly down to the nature of football where pure physicality is not the reason for success. Clouds of doubt do remain in the medical world surrounding footballers as it is felt that in some nations, especially Spain, doping laws are not adhered to as strictly and also there are (unproven) allegations that Football Associations may turn a blind eye so that it helps their teams and team coefficients within Europe. One thing that does fuel speculation is [Operacion Puerto](https://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/other-soccer/ewan-mackenna-murky-questions-surround-spanish-footballs-golden-era-and-people-might-not-like-the-answers-36943284.html) in Spain and the fact that the blood samples were destroyed by the government with many suspecting it would do damage to the reputations of Spain\'s greatest Sports stars. Recently Premier League players were also linked to a doping doctor but I think again [investigations did not turn up anything](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/04/04/doctor-at-centre-of-arsenal-chelsea-and-leicester-doping-allegat/). The main reason for suspicion is the lack of cheating with the number of players that are involved in Europe year in, year out.  It seems unlikely that an individual would not try to get ahead somehow.', 'Ferdinand was suspended a year if I remember correctly for not failing but “purposefully missing” a drug test and I believe Phil Jones and Daley Blind were both fined for doing the same after the Europa league win a couple years back \n\nYou should also look into baseball there’s a whole period where players juiced (Barry bonds the most famous) and there’s still debated on if there stats should be accepted but still in debate for hall of fame \n\nThey consider the time period of 1992-2003 the steroid era. Alex Rodriquez was caught in one season but still won the league MVP as it kind of became acceptable I guess but it would definitely add some interesting paragraphs to you assignment', 'When I think of doping baseball first comes to mind, you should be able to find ample examples. \n\nFor football, most recently, Mahrez missed out on the Community Shield game over doping concerns. He was not found guilty or anything, Man City did not want to risk him being tested from taking meds for a sickness while he was away for international duty. \n\nIn the history of football the two names that come to mind are Rio Ferdinand for EPL and Maradona in the 1994 World Cup. \n\nHope that helps.']"

349,r/PremierLeague,ncrooks11,Preview: Tottenham vs Newcastle,"Phew, Tottenham escapes the Etihad with a point… thank you VAR! Just as I predicted last week! (humble brag)

***“ Predicted Result***

*Neither team will be able to hold on for a clean sheet in this match but I fully expect the score line to be closer than many assume. We know how Spurs will look to lineup and counter the Man City attack just like they did in the second leg of the Champions League in April which saw them through to the Semi-Final. The big question is, will their defense be able to sustain the amount of pressure that the Citizens will throw at them? I foresee some controversy in this game with the addition of VAR to the Premier League which could push this game either way. All in all, each team takes a point from GW 2. “*

Tottenham will shift their focus now to Newcastle who will travel to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this Sunday, August 25th, at 11:30 EST.

Newcastle faces their second top-six opponent in their first three games and will try to gain any sort of momentum against a well organized Tottenham team. This may be a game in which Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino could look to rotate his squad, introducing players like new summer signing, Giovani Lo Celso and the returning from suspension, Son Heung-Min. I think Lucas Moura has earned himself a start this weekend and Harry Winks could be rested, due to the fact that they will not need as much defensive cover this weekend. Tottenham need to start fast and kill off this game early, the North London Derby is right around the corner.

**Likely Line-up: Tottenham 4-2-3-1**

Goalkeeper: Hugo Lloris

Defenders: Kyle Walker-Peters, Toby Alderweireld, Davinson Sanchez, Danny Rose

Midfielders: Tanguy NDombele, Moussa Sissoko, Cristian Eriksen, Lucas Moura, Son Heung-Min

Forward: Harry Kane

The biggest news this week is that Son Heung-Min is back from suspension and will look to start his 2019/20 Premier League campaign firing on all cylinders. Having survived their trip to the Etihad, very much thanks to VAR, Tottenham will look to take advantage of their match-up this weekend against Newcastle and secure another 3 points. Pochettino will look to put the pressure on Newcastle’s back line early and often in this fixture and Spurs will likely come away victors with large goal difference.

**Likely Line-Up: Newcastle 3-5-2**

Goalkeeper: Dubravka

Defenders: Paul Dummet, Jamaal Lascelles, Fabian Schar

Midfielders: Matt Ritchie, Ki Sung-Yueng, Isaac Hayden, Jonjo Shelvey, Emil Krafth

Forward: Joelinton, Miguel Almiron

Only two games into the 2019/20 Premier League season and it looks as though the Newcastle manager Steve Bruce is already on the hot seat. Having lost their first two games of the season, Newcastle look like a squad that lacks creativity in attack and will have a hard time matching up to their Premier League counterparts. With that being said, they face the daunting task of keeping Harry Kane, Son Heung-Min, and the rest of the Tottenham attack off the score sheet in a match-up that will likely see Spurs with almost 80% of the possession.

**FPL Players to Watch**

In no particular order I believe that these are the players to keep an eye out going into GW 3.

(Player Pricing based off OFPL)

**TOT:** Kane (£11m), Eriksen (£8.9m), Son (£9.5m), Moura (7.5m)

**NEW:** Joelinton (£6.0m)

Realistically you could consider every player on Tottenham’s roster that you believe will participate in this fixture. I myself will be captaining Kane and quite possibly will pull the trigger and triple captain him this weekend. Son is coming back from suspension and will look to get right back onto the score sheet. Expect these two to have at least one goal, if not multiple. As for Newcastle, the only player that looks likely to make a difference is their front man, Joelinton.

**Predicted Result**

This game could be over before the half-time whistle. Confidence among the Newcastle side is low at the moment and Spurs will be looking to solidify their defense and tally their first clean sheet of the season. Expect the likes of Lucas Moura and Son Heung-Min to run rampant in this match-up, with Harry Kane likely to benefit from their attacking pressure. It’s very hard to predict anything more than a Tottenham win this weekend, the biggest question is just how many goals will they tally and can they hold Newcastle scoreless?

&amp;#x200B;

 Wolverhampton Wanderers

**7 Rui Patricio**

Played well and saved the penalty

**6.5 Ryan Bennett**

Well positioned for the whole game. He did make a mistake near the end of the first half which nearly led to a goal.

**7 Conor Coady**

Well organised and good positioning. Put in 4 tackles and an interception. He did give away the penalty though. Not as good on the ball though with a 58 % passing accuracy.

**7.5 Willy Boly**

Had a real presence in the defence. He wasn’t afraid to step into the midfield to win the ball because he always had the cover behind him. He also covered Jonny well out wide. Put in 4 tackles and 2 interceptions.

**6.5 Matt Doherty - Subbed out at 45 Minutes**

Looked solid defensively but didn’t offer much going forward.

**7.25 Jonny**

Kept Daniel James very quiet for most of the game and got forward well in the second half. Made several good interceptions.

**6.5 Leander Dendoncker**

Didn’t have as much of a presence as the other 2 in the midfield but was well disciplined and kept the shape well.

**7.5 Ruben Neves**

Scored a brilliant long range goal. Made good tackles and interceptions. His passing was good and he always looks to get the ball forward. 

**7.75 Joao Moutinho**

The main creative force of the team. His passing was great, especially the assist for Neves. He isn’t afraid to get stuck in and put in tackles. Very good all round performance.

**7.25 Raul Jiminez**

Dropped back to help out the midfield when United had the ball. Had good hold up play and brought others into the attack. Very unlucky not to score with his header off the post.

**6.5 Jota - Subbed out at 86 Minutes**

Kept a good shape defensively but the conceded possession more than anyone else. His passing was decent though.

Subs

**7.75 Adam Traore - Subbed in at 45 Minutes**

Big impact off the bench. Showed lightning pace and good ball control. His crossing was also impressive. Well organised defensively too.

&amp;#x200B;

Manchester United

**6.5 David De Gea**

He was quick off his line to get to Maguire’s dodgy back pass towards the end of the game. Couldn’t do much about the goal and wasn’t really tested otherwise. 

**6.5 Victor Lindelof**

Fairly solid performance but made a big miss kick in the first half that luckily didn’t to a goal.

**7.25 Harry Maguire**

Looked good in the air and made a lot of good passes. Cleared a lot of balls as well.

**7.75 Aaron Wan-Bissaka**

He is so hard to get the ball past. He looked so solid and made an incredible 9 tackles. Sometimes he left James a bit isolated but overlapped more in the second half. Looks like a superb signing.

**7 Luke Shaw**

Overlapped very well including being vital in the creation of the United goal. His defensive positioning was good as well.

**6.5 Scott McTominay**

Good in the air and looked alright defensively but lacks creativity on the ball. Too much sideways passing.

**6.5 Paul Pogba**

Same as McTominay with a lack of creativity and too much simple sideways passing.   Pretty decent defensively though. 

**6 Daniel James - Subbed out at 89 Minutes**

Struggled in the first half to make an impact often due to have little support. Had more of an impact in the second half as Wan Bissaka got forward to help him out. He definitely needs to improve his crossing. Didn’t track back.

**5.75 Jesse Lingard - Subbed out at 81 Minutes**

Like a lot of the rest of team he lacked creativity. 

**6.25 Marcus Rashford - Subbed out at 89 Minutes**

Didn’t make enough runs which made it hard for the midfielders to make anything happen. His lack of tracking back is going to lead to problems against better teams. His set pieces weren’t great and he gave the ball away too often. His assist to Martial was very good however and he won several free kicks. 

**6.5 Anthony Martial**

Took his goal brilliantly but his movement and general hold up play isn’t good enough.

This is my ratings scale

Basing this scale on the English league

9.25 or above - Performance for the ages. Very Rarely seen (Messi will hit this level a couple of times a season)

8.5 - 9 - Brilliant. Can't see much better on a football pitch. Most top players only hit this level on their best days

8 - 8.25 - Truly Great. These players are world class, mostly only seen from the best players in the Champions League qualification places

7.5 - 7.75 - Very Good. The higher standard of the top half players will hit this level pretty regularly

7 - 7.25 - Good. The general standard for top half players

6.5 - 6.75 - Decent. Weaker Top half and the best of the bottom half players players will usually hit this level

6 - 6.25 - Okay. Bottom half players will play at this level regularly

5.5 - 5.75 - Average. Top Level Relegated players will usually play at this level

5 - 5.25 - Mediocre. Most Relegated Players will play at this level

4 - 5.5 - Championship Level

3 - 4.5 - League One Level

1.5 - 3 - League Two Level

0 - 1.5 - Non-League Level

357,r/PremierLeague,ncrooks11,3 Words to Sum-Up the Top Six after GW 2,"**Manchester City - S'Over Move On -**  I managed to make ""it's over"" one word just for the sake of the article title, but Man City need to get over this draw against Tottenham. Yes, Pep, the players, and the fans, will feel hard done by the VAR decision to take away Jesus' goal in stoppage time, but they will have to take the good with the bad and move forward after their dominating performance. 

**Liverpool - Defense Needs Improvement -** The last time that Liverpool were able to hold on to a clean sheet was during a friendly against Tranmere Rovers, back in early July. If they are going to mount another title challenge this year, they will have to improve defensively. They will truly be put to the test defensively when they host Arsenal at the weekend.

**Tottenham - VAR the MVP -** Everyone has seen the replays and everyone has their own opinion about the outcome. To me (a Tottenham supporter) the rule is clear and any incident of a handball cannot result in a goal scoring opportunity. Also as a Tottenham supporter, they played extremely poor, but were able to take their chances and ""hold on"" for a point. 

**Manchester United - F\*ck Racism Man -** There are things larger than football and racism is one of them. There is no place for it in this world. We are all human beings and are prone to error, pick your head up and move on. With that being said, taking a point from Wolves away is not the worst thing to happen to this club in the last few years. 

**Arsenal - Tough Road Ahead -** Sitting second in the Premier League table only behind Liverpool, Arsenal have managed all three points in their first two games. With a trip to Anfield at the weekend, they have the opportunity to sit alone at the top of the table, but will have to play three of the top six clubs in the next five game weeks!

**Chelsea - Lampard In Trouble? -** He's one of their own, but how long will they give him to succeed at Chelsea? With Norwich and Sheffield United up next, the fans will be looking for nothing less than all three points in their next two games. They came out firing against Leicester and even I thought it could be a 4-5 goal performance from Chelsea, but they just went flat. How long do you think Lampard will survive at the helm if they cannot start turning it around?

Utd only drew due to a world class goal and should’ve won via their penalty - plus their defence is such a solid foundation now. I’m worried that they could nick 4th ahead of us but right now our manager is better so hopefully that will decide it (plus our better front 3). Spurs went toe to toe with Man City, but I think their form versus the non top six could give them a decent title challenge - although they’re a long way off Liverpool at the moment. Liverpool could win the league purely down to Pep focusing on the UCL, but Liverpool’s GK crisis could lose many points - combined with Liverpool’s new higher line. Man City are obviously playing the same as last season, but winning by only 1 point is a bit worrying and with VAR they might finish second purely down to events like the Spurs match. Chelsea might turn out to be alright, but they’ve lost key players and have no chance on paper of finish in the top 4 - plus European nights will probably tire out their team so much that Lampard’s presence won’t fuel a genuine top 4 chance. Arsenal are looking alright, although Burnley showed that our defence is still dodgy and we will have to outscore teams to finish in the top 4. Will be between Man U and Arsenal for top 4, I reckon we’ll get it due to the mathematical chance of accumulating more points via scoring more goals - but we’ll wait and see.\nI’ve written a lot 😅 if you read all of that, thank you!

360,r/PremierLeague,EzioAuditore-Evie,VAR Table vs. Non-VAR Table*After Week 2(All Matches Completed),"Note: Not sure if I need the weekly disclaimer or not. Prefer without as it keeps the post more manageable. Long story short, this thread tracks how VAR changes the table. Basically, things that were goals last year get reviewed this year and then get taken away changing the final score and the final table. Yeah, butterfly effect and all. I also found a more reliable source for the 3-4 matches I don't see per week. Personally, I like VAR and I hope it makes the final table more accurately reflect the real final as it (hopefully) fixes ref errors.

Big decisions Through 2 Weeks:

1.VAR takes away a Wolverhampton goal vs. Leicester City. Result changes from 1-0 Wolves win to 0-0 Draw. Wolves loses 2 points, Leicester gains 1.

2.VAR takes away a Brighton goal vs. West Ham. Result Changes from 2-1 Brighton win to 1-1 draw. Brighton loses 2 points, West Ham gains 1.

3.VAR takes away a Manchester City goal vs. Tottenham. Result changes from 3-2 City win to 2-2 draw. City loses 2 points, Tottenham gains 1.

Verdict: I feel 100% confident in Manchester City and Wolverhampton winning those matches if this were last year where VAR doesn't fix the refs mistakes. City goal came in stoppage time where Tottenham drawing would have been nearly impossible. Leicester was pushing just as hard for a goal at 0-0 as if they were down 0-1, so I feel confident saying they wouldn't have scored. I didn't watch the Brighton match, but based on match reports it seems fair to say Brighton wins this match 2-1 if it was like last year where VAR didn't take away the goal.

377,r/PremierLeague,JohnByrne013,Arsenal vs. Burnley - Player Ratings,"These are my personal ratings for the match. I'm just a casual fan, far from an expert so feel free to discuss in the comments what you think.

&amp;#x200B;

**Arsenal**

**5.75 Berndt Leno**

Struggled with set pieces sent in deep and didn't command his area very well. Good reaction save in the first half even though it was offside.

**7 David Luiz**

Looked confident and pretty well organised. Made 7 clearances. Sometimes struggled with set pieces.

**6.75 Sokratis Papastathopoulos**

Didn't do great with aerial balls in the first half but won a lot of them in the second. Was well organised also in general play.

**6 Ainsley Maitland-Niles.**

Inconsistent throughout. Has a tendency to over-commit and get exposed. Generally is able to recover well though. Needs to improve his crossing.

**7.25 Nacho Monreal**

Looked good defensively and offensively, creating a few chances. Seemed a bit confused at times when defending set-pieces though.

**7 Matteo Guendouzi**

Passed the ball forward a lot and looked composed through. Looked decent defensively as well and made 4 interceptions.

**8.5 Dani Ceballos - Subbed out at 83 Minutes**

Has a wonderful talent for creating space for himself. His passing was top quality as was his movement off the ball. Defending really well and covered a lot of ground.

**7.25 Joe Willock**

Much better than last week. Looked very comfortable on the ball and created space well. Used good passing and defended well.

**7.25 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang**

Didn't have much of an impact in the first half. His movement caused a lot of problems in the second half and his goal was very well taken. His lack of tracking back is an issue though.

**6.5 Reiss Nelson** \- **Subbed out at 45 Minutes**

Tracked back well. Didn’t have much of an impact going forward. Had a decent chance that he hit straight at the keeper. Slight improvement on last week.

**6.5 Alexandre Lacazette - Subbed out at 71 Minutes**

Took his goal excellently but should have scored the header just before. Had little impact on the rest of the game other a few passes here and there

Subs

**7 Nicolas Pepe - Subbed in at 45 Minutes**

Had some moments of brilliance. His pass to Aubameyang on the counter attack towards the end was poor though. He looks like he could be a quality player. Can't wait to see him play a full match.

**6 Sead Kolasinac - Subbed in at 71 Minutes**

&amp;#x200B;

**Burnley**

**7.5 Nick Pope**

Made several good saves although should have done better for Lacazette's goal. His kickouts aren't the best.

**7 James Tarkowski**

Good in the air and made some good tackles.

**6.75 Ben Mee**

Same as Tarkowski but was exposed a couple of times.

**6.75 Matthew Lowton**

Defended well and looked decent going forward.

**6.5 Erik Pieters**

Looked good at both ends. Sent in some good crosses. Shouldn't have let Lacazette turn for his goal though.

**6.5 Ashley Westwood**

Disciplined performance. Kept a good shape and pressed well. Didn't look quite as good on the ball with 69% pass success.

**7 Jack Cork**

Also held the shape very well and put in good aggressive tackles. Had some passing as well. His impact going forward was lessened in the second half.

**6.5 Johann Gudmundsson - Subbed out at** **72 Minutes**

Crossing could have been better but looked alright down the wing. Kept a well disciplined shape defensively.

**6.5 Dwight McNeil**

Gave away possession a few times and didn't always track back. His set-piece deliveries caused Arsenal problems. Had some good dribbles as well.

**7 Ashley Barnes**

Hard working in the press from the goal kicks. Did well in the air and took his goal nicely.

**7 Chris Wood - Subbed out at** **61 Minutes**

Also pressed well on the goal kick and caused problems in the air. Wasn't bad with the ball at his feet either.

Subs

**6 Jay Rodriguez - Subbed in at** **61 Minutes**

**7 Aaron Lennon - Subbed in at 72 Minutes**

This is my ratings scale (Roughly threw this together)

Basing this scale on the English league

9.25 or above - Performance for the ages. Very Rarely seen (Messi will hit this level a couple of times a season)

8.5 - 9 - Brilliant. Can't see much better on a football pitch. Most top players only hit this level on their best days

8 - 8.25 - Truly Great. These players are world class, mostly only seen from the best players in the Champions League qualification places

7.5 - 7.75 - Very Good. The higher standard of the top half players will hit this level pretty regularly

7 - 7.25 - Good. The general standard for top half players

6.5 - 6.75 - Decent. Weaker Top half and the best of the bottom half players players will usually hit this level

6 - 6.25 - Okay. Bottom half players will play at this level regularly

5.5 - 5.75 - Average. Top Level Relegated players will usually play at this level

5 - 5.25 - Mediocre. Most Relegated Players will play at this level

4 - 5.5 - Championship Level

3 - 4.5 - League One Level

1.5 - 3 - League Two Level

0 - 1.5 - Non-League Level

And as I mentioned in the comments, I already had another script written  and one of those was for the new Kits. And you can find that video [here](https://youtu.be/txgIbBIgJ2c)!

Week 2's awards will be posted after the United-Wolves game on monday, see yall then.

And so this is not just a self promo post, because for me it is more about making people laugh than anything else, here is the text for the 2019/2020 Kits Awards.

 

PL KIT AWARDS

**Best throwback award**

\-United. Most significant change, moreso than arsenal.The black background to the crest is what sets it apart

**Most likely to remind me to add mustard to my hotdog award**

\-Arsenal Away

**Worst Goalkeeping kit award**

\-All of them. Literally all of them. Especially adidas’

**Worst sleeve sponsor award**

\-Everton with their angry birds. I cannot take them seriously

**The “please burn it with fire and never let it see the light of day”**

\-Newcastle 3rd kit. No. No no no no. no. bad newcastle bad!

**Worst “improvement”**

\-Under Armor making the shoulder panel much different. Especially with southampton

**Best Marketing Campaign**

\-Chelsea! Signed Pulisic and then copied the USMNT kit for all the boy wonder fan boys

**Ugliest all around**

\-Norwich had very bad color choices for their return to the premier league.

**The “exactly what I expected” award**

\-Sheffield United Home

\-Aston Villa Home

\-Spurs Home

\-Wolves home

\-Burnley Home

Best Redesign

\-West Ham’s home kit

**The “You literally did not even try” award**

\-Adidas and Leicester. The away and third kits are literally just base adidas shirts that say king power and have the leicester crest on them. Sad.

**The best black kit-**

Liverpool 3rd and GK. The third kit is a good black kit without it being too boring and the GK kit with the gold accents are perfect.

**Worst explanation for a kit**

\-Everton’s “living coral” theres no coral anywhere near merseyside.

**The “makes me kinda thirsty for a strawberry lemonade” kit**

\-Man city’s 3rd. Not sure what puma where thinking here

**The “didn’t need to go so hard” award.**

\-Man City’s 125th anniversary kit. Puma knocked it out of the park with this clean design. 

**The “your kit sponsor is a lie” award**

\-Fun 88 for newcastle. No one is having fun at newcastle.

**The “Only gold youll have this season” award**

\-Man United for their gold away Kit

**The “just because it is different, doesnt make it good” award**

\-Newcastle’s home kit. Putting the kit maker, crest, and sponsor all in a line on the same vertical stripe looks terrible. Almost as bad as sacking a world class manager in Rafa Benitez in favor of steve bruce.

**The “does the lack of color count as a color?” award**

\-Sheffield United’s away and third kit. As bland and uninspired as their team on the pitch is.

**The “looks like a literal trainwreck” award**

\-Chelsea’s home. Why. it just looks so ugly and busy. It looks like standford bridge collapsed.

**The most unneccesary collar award**

\-Spurs 3rd kit. Why, Nike? Just… why?

**The worst kit sponsor award**

\-Crystal Palace’s ManbetX or Burnley’s LoveBet. Although Chevrolet hideous giant gold brick in the center of United’s kits is an eyesore, it is not as big of a turnoff as these two cashgrab kit sponsors are. Which is a shame because crystal Palace has some good kits this year.

**The best sponsor award**

\-Liverpool’s Standard Charter. The text is a very good font and the slight logo on the side looks fantastic.

**The “these are literally the exact same kit, you didnt even try” award**

\-Aston Villa and Burnley’s home kits.",self.PremierLeague,Discussion,1566049595.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/cri9fh/premier_league_awards_update/,/r/PremierLeague/comments/cri9fh/premier_league_awards_update/,5,1,1,"['Really proud of you for choosing to continue this.

Plus, our players have good heads on their shoulders. There are no egos in this squad, and that is due to our gaffer. He has zero tolerance for acting out, or not being invested in the vision.\n\nThere is an incredible sense of community whether it's losing your voice belting out the [Firmino chant](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zcfd1Vonshc), running around the house after we [take the piss out Everton again](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=K-LzI7tg_w4&amp;t=33s), or supporting foodbanks around England.

First off, they share their owners in FSG, who saved the club from going under in 2010, at the 11th hour. They've also revitalized us, so that our current form matches our illustrious history, and that our future will be just as bright, even after Klopp and this current side have left. Despite being one of the biggest clubs in English football(18 Leagues, 8 League Cups, 7 FA Cups), we...haven't won the English league in a while, again, like the Sox a few years ago(We are currently top of the league though...fingers crossed). Also, if you're a Philadelphia Eagles fan, you'll know what it's like for rival fans to hate you...\n\nI also don't think I've mentioned our record in Europe enough. We are far and away, the most successful English club in the competitions. 4 Super Cups and Europa Leagues. It's hard to give a fuck about those, when you are THE REIGNING CHAMPIONS OF EUROPE. 1977,1978, 1984, 2005[(the jewel of them all, best final in fucking history, etc, etc...)](https://youtu.be/oWdPDofBxl0), and 2019. That is 6, I repeat **SIX** European Cups, third only to Milan and Real Madrid. Watch any of these games and you're setting yourself up with a chance to see a moment in football history. We light it up on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. Liverpool and European nights. Name a better duo. I'll wait.\n\nAnd our memes are the best. The others could never.\n\n\nSo, summary time.\n\nWhy Liverpool?\n\n1. CHAMPIONS OF EUROPE\n\n2. History of success(England, Europe, it doesn't matter.

I was getting burned out on America sports at the time and was flipping through the channels on a weekend in July and NBC Sports was showing a Liverpool game from the previous season. The game was at Anfield and the crowd singing YNWA gave me GOOSEBUMPS. Watched the game and was so impressed with the sounds of the crowd singing through the entire game. Liverpool had Andy Carroll at that time and he was so impressive to me, Lol. Yes I know about Carroll now.\n\nBut on that day I fell in love with the EPL. So I started researching everything on the League and the sport. Like I literally studied the League, I learned all the teams, went to all the stadiums on Google Earth and learned how the pro/reg. System worked. Figured out about Champions League and I was so impressed how it all works. Arsenals badge/logo had me sold but Liverpool was the first team I watched play so I love both teams. When they play each other I just hope for a bunch of goals and no injuries, unless one of them has a shot at the title or a top 4 spot is up for grabs. Klopp has made me root for LFC even more.

You wouldn’t be jumping on any bandwagon but arsenal has revamped their management and ownership to match clubs like City or Liverpool. This paired with the abundance of youth talent makes the future look awfully bright at the Emirates. \n\n3.Overall Arsenal is considered one of the classiest Clubs throughout Europe. We’ve been well respected by many of the top teams and top players of the last couple of decades. Arsenal Wenger epitomized this class perfectly. \n\n4.Our history rivals that of any club in the premier league. Most FA Cups, 100+ years in the top division without going down, went 49 games without loosing, along with some of the greatest players to ever grace the English game.(Henry, Bergkamp, Vierra). \n\n5.Rivalries are always at a plenty with arsenal. Their  history has led to rivalries against Liverpool, Man U, and of course the biggest one of them all, the north London derby with Tottenham. The added bite to these games makes them far more fun to watch win or loose.\n\nE: Grammar']"

&amp;#x200B;

[The Kyle Walker Match Week 1 Memorial Trophy Award](https://imgur.com/a/xNGSQav) \-- the award given to the player who best embodies the spirit of Kyle Walker’s Own Goal to open the 2016 season.

\-Grant Hanley for his inspirational own [goal](https://youtu.be/zEEPjqDMXDM?t=8) to start the scoring for Liverpool

&amp;#x200B;

***The “You should probably find a new stadium” Award*** \-- 

\-West Ham, for losing a combined 22-1 in their last 5 matches at home to Manchester City

&amp;#x200B;

***The “Last thing you want to hear from your new signing” Award*** \--

\-West Ham’s Sebastian Haller, who said before the match *“What a sh\*t game to start with!” he joked to the* [*Mirror*](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/what-s-game-start-with-18876280)*. “I go there for a lot of money, now first game City! Why?*

*“There are better games to build your confidence! Hopefully I will touch the ball! We will see.”*

&amp;#x200B;

***The “Hoes mad” Award*** \--

\-Watford’s Roberto Pereyra for[yelling at the ref for a handball](https://youtu.be/sIMmXJEQOXk?t=353)

&amp;#x200B;

***The “We’re so VARry” Award --***

\-Given to Gabriel Jesus, for his goal being [disallowed because VAR](https://youtu.be/6KRG2hLm4ZQ?t=87) saw that Sterling’s \*Checks notes\* armpit…? Was offsides… and thus disallowed the goal (not that it made any impact to the game).

&amp;#x200B;

***The “Not suited for the Premier League” Award --***

\-Jannik Vestergaard for his inability to mark Ashley Barnes as well as track the ball while its in the air. I mean you're 6'6"" you should be able to track it better considering you are so much closer to it.

&amp;#x200B;

***The “1-1” Award --*** Given to the two teams who play embodied the spirit of what it means to play to a 1-1 Draw.

\-Bournemouth &amp; Sheffield United- Both goals coming from broken set piece plays with a lot of sloppy play and almost no offense going either direction.

&amp;#x200B;

***The Jose Mourinho 0-0 Memorial Trophy Award --***  *Given to the two teams who embodied what it means to do nothing for 90 minutes just to earn one point.* 

\-Wolves, who possessed the ball less than 30% of the game, conceded 13 fouls vs Leicester’s 3, had 34 clearances, 8 shots with only 2 on target, and only 290 completed passes vs Leicester’s 660. Truly a Mourinho-esque performance from Wolves. Also neither team made all 3 of their subs…

&amp;#x200B;

***The “We should have seen this coming” Award --***

\-Newcastle, who sacked Rafa Benitez in favor of Steve Bruce and looked all of worthless in attack. And to not let that arsenal backline get away with a clean sheet? Sad.

&amp;#x200B;

***The “If you had fun, you won” Award --***

\-Jesse Lingard who ran around the pitch at Old Trafford for 86 minutes only to have zero impact on the match.

&amp;#x200B;

**Debuting the Debut awards --** The debut season for the debut awards given to players on their debut’s for their new club’s.

&amp;#x200B;

***The best single player debut--***

\-Erik Pieters picked up [2 fantastic assists](https://youtu.be/Ht_twqRGp2M?t=387), both of which were to Ashley Barnes. The first being a long range chip over the Southampton backline and the other was a cross from deep that perfectly found Barnes’ foot to volley it home

&amp;#x200B;

***The worst single player debut--***

\-Sebastian Haller, for his comments before the match against Man City and then not finding the net in the game also hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

***The best group of players debut--***

\-Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan-Bissaka played good defense en route to a clean sheet versus Chelsea, while Dan James scored his first PL goal on his first shot attempt.

&amp;#x200B;

***The Worst group of players debut--*** 

\-Chelsea, aside from Tammy Abraham hitting the post in the 4th minute, he, Mount, and Pulisic all looked in over their heads in their debut against Man Utd, not to mention Frank Lampard also being given this award for his managerial debut for the club.

&amp;#x200B;

***The “Score a goal on your debut so the fans forget how bad you were for the other 72 minutes” Award --***

\-Tanguy Ndombele, who looked wobbly, unsure of himself, and out of his element for 72 minutes versus Aston Villa before rifling a [22 yarder past Mings and Heaton](https://youtu.be/NbBKTnWOUrw?t=12). Spurs fans may be angry about this one but any outsider watching the game would tell you the same thing.

&amp;#x200B;

***The “Young Italian striker making his debut with roughly 20 minutes left in a 0-0 game but did not make any impact” Award--***

\-Moise Kean and Patrick Crutone, whose debuts for their new clubs could easily be swapped with each other and no one would know the difference.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the regular awards

&amp;#x200B;

***The “Played your heart out but still lost” Award --***

\-Tyrone Mings and Tom Heaton. Villa did a fantastic job holding off Tottenham for 65 minutes after John McGinn’s opening goal. Mings played a vital role in the defense with many clutch blocks and interceptions… Until Ndombele released a blast from outside the box and neither could react in time. Then for the second goal Mings did a good job blocking the shot but got incredibly unluckyyyyyyyy when it ricocheted off his fellow defender and right into the path of one of the most clinical strikers in the league, leaving Heaton helpless.

&amp;#x200B;

***The OG OG award --***  Given to the OG who scored the worst OG.

\-Abdoulaye Doucoure, [who redirected a cross right past ben foster](https://youtu.be/sIMmXJEQOXk?t=192) and into the net for the opener for Brighton.

&amp;#x200B;

***The Biggest Loser Award --***

\-Jack Grealish, who has lost 17 straight PL games, a record. All of Ireland parties in wake of your historic record.

&amp;#x200B;

***The “You didn’t mean to do it but it still worked so we won’t question it” Award --***

\-Anthony Martial, who scored buy swinging [his right boot too late for the cross but it hit his left leg](https://youtu.be/w6oHaOkrHEw?t=74)right before he wanted to make contact then perfectly struck it through Kepa’s legs. So even though you probably meant to hit it first time no one will question it.

&amp;#x200B;

(Ok time for real awards)

&amp;#x200B;

***Best Counter Attack of the week--***

\-[Man Utd’s 4th goal](https://youtu.be/zDShh2ODSdA?t=56)vs Chelsea. Picked the ball up in their own 18 and score Through Dan James only a few passes later.

&amp;#x200B;

***Most Questionable Starting Lineup--***

\-Spurs. Before Eriksen was brought on they seemed adrift on offense. There was no creative spark at all on the field, just Kane running at Mings and hoping for the best. Not sure what Poch’s plan was but once the Dane came on it was smooth sailing for them.

&amp;#x200B;

***Best Goal--***

[\-John McGinn for Villa](https://youtu.be/O7PlNPUX6AM?t=7), who received a fantastic chip from Mings, sent Danny Rose for a hotdog, and fired it past Lloris.

&amp;#x200B;

***Luckiest Goal--***

\-Although I wrote quite a few words about the gracious deflection martial received off his left leg, the luckiest of the week would have to go to Kane, [who saw a clearance bounce off the man marking](https://youtu.be/V16POjCOtpw?t=2) him and leaving him 1 on 1 with Heaton, where he made no mistake, quite a good finish that. Honorable mention goes to Billy Sharp for being unmarked and pouncing on a loose ball inside the 6.

&amp;#x200B;

***Unluckiest to concede (GK)--***

\-A tie between Tom Heaton and Dean Henderson.[Heaton saved a point blank effort from Davison Sanchez](https://youtu.be/NbBKTnWOUrw?t=1) only for his team to give an acre of space to Ndombele to blast it past him moments later.[Henderson saved a point blank shot](https://youtu.be/mypVh5TO_FQ?t=379)from Callum Wilson only for it to be deflected into an area with zero white shirts and gets it hammered past him from 4 yards away while still recovering from the initial save.

&amp;#x200B;

***Best Assist--***

[\-Erik Pieters long range cross](https://youtu.be/Ht_twqRGp2M?t=461) to Barnes. From miles away to perfectly lofting it to Barnes' boot.

&amp;#x200B;

426,r/PremierLeague,ncrooks11,Review: Tottenham vs Aston Villa,"Tenacity and perseverance saw Tottenham through against Aston Villa in game week 1. As I predicted in my preview of this game, Aston Villa were able to knick a goal against Spurs, but were not able to hang on to that slim lead late into the second half. Tottenham looked lackluster in the first half and were caught out by a long ball over the top from Tyrone Mings that John McGinn was able to chase down and calmly finish past Hugo Lloris in the 9th minute of the game. 

After halftime, Mauricio Pochettino ditched his diamond midfield tactic and brought on Cristian Eriksen in the 64th minute and moved to a 4-2-3-1 formation. With Sissoko and Moura on the wings and Lamela in-behind Kane, Eriksen was given the reigns to pick passes from a deep lying midfielder role and proved vital in their battle to get back level. Tanguy Ndombele had an outstanding second half and provided the equalizer in the 73rd minute, on his Premier League debut, with a sweetly struck ball from 25 yards out, curling one past Tom Heaton. 

Momentum was firmly with Tottenham after their equalizer and the pressure got to Villa who conceded the game winner in the 86th minute to none other than Harry Kane. An Erik Lamela shot deflected by Jack Grealish found its way to the English front-man and he made no mistake from 8 yards out. He then added an insurance goal, calmly and expertly slotted into the bottom corner in the 90th minute assisted by Moussa Sissoko. 

Overall, it was a game that had Spurs fans, including myself, worried through the first half thinking they were never going to break through an unyielding Aston Villa defense. This game also showed the importance of Cristian Eriksen in the Tottenham side, as well as the lack of creativity in the starting eleven without him, Dele Alli, or Son Heung-Min. The best bit of business that Spurs could do all summer would be to tie him down to a new contract and cement his place in the team for years to come. 

**Individual Player Quick Hits** 

**Lloris** \- Not much to do outside of McGinn’s goal in which he seemed unnaturally stagnant, otherwise did his job well (6/10)

**Rose** \- Defensively was caught out of position when Trezeguet was played in on goal and should have made it 2-0. Attacking down the left and was a nuisance all game without much end product (5/10)

**Alderweireld** \- Did his job and mostly flew under the radar in this game, consistently spewing cross-field passes for which the Belgian is known for (6/10)

**Sanchez** \- Got locked in on Wesley and was at fault for McGinn’s goal, outside of that had a quiet game, will likely miss out next week against City with Jan coming back (4/10)

**Walker-Peters** \- Played exceptionally well and was sound in defense and on the attack always willing to overlap. Could take over as the starting RB option with a few more of these games and if he’s able to provide key assists which we all know he’s capable of (6/10) 

**Ndombele** \- Outstanding second half after scoring the equalizer on his debut, showed great confidence after the goal and will be a force to be reckoned with when he gets a few games under his belt (8/10)

**Sissoko** \-  Had a great look at goal and skewed a ball out of play, typical Sissoko finishing. Provided cover for KWP and did his job well carrying the ball and going at defenders when deployed on the right. (7/10)

**Winks** \- Strong in midfield and calm on the ball, made an outstanding open field tackle on McGinn that thwarted a counter attack. If he can stay healthy he will be a staple in the midfield (7/10)

**Lamela** \- Typical game for him, motors around the pitch being a pest and can’t really seem to string things together in attacking midfield, earned himself his standard per-match yellow card in the 87th minute (5/10)

**Moura** \- Should have scored in the 2nd minute of the game with an open header in the 6 yard box but was able to provide the assist for Ndombele’s goal in the second half, outside of that not one of his better performances (6/10)

**Kane** \- Like most of the team he was quiet in the first half and should have scored on a header just before halftime. Took his chances well in the second half and gave us the cushion needed to see the game out (8/10)

**Sub: Eriksen** \- Completely changed the game when he came on for Winks in the 64th minute. Picked his passes well and provided that creative spark that was lacking in the first half (9/10)

**Sub: Nkoudou** \- N/A

**Sub: Skipp** \- N/A

427,r/PremierLeague,ncrooks11,3 Words to Sum-Up the Top Six after GW 1,"**Manchester City** \- **Above and Beyond** \- City showed again why they are odds on favorites to win the Premier League again for third time in a row. Nothing else needs to be said.

**Liverpool** \- **Chasing City Again?** \- Liverpool are going to be the closest contenders with City yet again, but can they win the decisive games against their top of the table rivals?

**Tottenham** \- **Never Say Die** \- Spurs under Pochettino have shown resiliency over the last few season in games that they normally would have lost or drawn in years past. Can they dig deep enough to be title challengers though? 

**Manchester United** \- **Don't Get Cocky** \- An outstanding performance against a top six rival in GW 1 is definitely something to be happy about, but one game with a side that has changed quite a bit, it's tough to call what they will be or what they can achieve this year.

**Arsenal** \- **It Was....Something** \- I firmly believe that if Arsenal played any other side in GW 1 they would not have gotten all 3 points. But it holds true that you can only play the team in front of you and Arsenal managed to take care of business with a very depleted squad.

**Chelsea** \- **Don't Lose Hope** \- If Abraham's shot catches the inside of the post and scores, this could have been a very different game. Got caught out a few times and were ultimately put to the sword by a clinical Manchester squad. A lot of positives to take away from this game and will take time under Lampard to develop.

428,r/PremierLeague,FeelsLike37,Potential Improvements To VAR In The Premier League,"I'd be interested to find out fans' thoughts on an addition to VAR that I'd like to see tested in football. This rule comes from cricket in which there is a detailed, developed and well respected review system (VAR) in place. As is stands in Football we currently have two outcomes from a VAR review: Decision stands. or Decision overturned. This creates, as we've seen, very close decisions for instance, the Handball decision that ruled out Dendoncker's goal for Wolves in game-week 1 at Leicester. 

People seem to have varying opinions on what constitutes deliberate handball vs unintentional handball and therefore, fans' views will always be varied as to whether VAR is successful in a given ruling. In Cricket, there is a 3rd ruling that may be made as well as the two previously mentioned: Umpire's call (Referee's call). This is ruled in scenarios which would be potentially be controversial. This means that, even after looking as the footage frame by frame, it's still can be hard for the video referee to make a correct decision with confidence. In this case, the ruling made by the on field umpire would stand. In the example of the LEI V WOL game Wolves would have won 1-0 with this in place. On another day however the match referee may have himself disallowed the goal and with the same ruling the game would have finished 0-0.

Like I said, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts as well as other variations you might make on top of this. For instance: each team having 1 review each to consult VAR.",self.PremierLeague,Discussion,1565641233.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/cpbm9s/potential_improvements_to_var_in_the_premier/,/r/PremierLeague/comments/cpbm9s/potential_improvements_to_var_in_the_premier/,9,1,1,"['I think VAR should be used only for offsides and goals.

I actually like that rule because it doesn\'t leave room for the controversy of determining intent.\n\nIn terms of the 3rd VAR outcome option, it\'s the same outcome as ""the ruling stands"". So what is the purpose of giving that option other than giving the VAR official a CYA?', 'I think it should be used only for big offsides. Not like in the man city game, where sterling was just milimiters offside. \n\nAn for example in the same game, the first penalty, the west ham keeper was able to save, in my opinion should have been valid.

431,r/PremierLeague,GeoffreyGeoffson,[OC] Why do teams that qualify for Europe see such a drop off in points the next season.,"While previewing Wolverhampton, in the Football Weekly preview pod, Barry Glendenning made an interesting statistical point; Premier League sides who qualify for Europe see a dramatic points reduction the following year.

While football media tends to be quick to blame European drop-off on fixture congestion or a lack of winter break – I couldn’t help listening and asking what is really going on?

Since Everton – led by a still universally admired David Moyes clamped up the 7th European spot in the early 2010s - six different English clubs have used the Premiership to go anti Nigel Farage and jump into Europe. Excepting Wolverhampton, these are those teams, and the points they received. 

**Points. Team. (yr before pts, yr after pts)**

54 Burnley (40,40)

61 Everton (47,49)

81 Leicester (41, 44)

62 West Ham (47, 45)

63 Southampton (60, 46)

60 Southampton (56, 63)

What is fascinating – is that each of these teams (except for the 63 point Southampton side) has a remarkably similar points total the year before, and the year after qualification. The qualifying year seems to be an exception, not, as each team's fans will at some point claim it to be, a new normal. 

What we see here then, is a pretty classic regression to the mean. Average team has an above-average year due to mostly luck, luck goes away, and the team reverts to playing the average football it did before the extraordinary year.",self.PremierLeague,Discussion,1565618229.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/cp89dv/oc_why_do_teams_that_qualify_for_europe_see_such/,/r/PremierLeague/comments/cp89dv/oc_why_do_teams_that_qualify_for_europe_see_such/,7,1,1,"['Is it not obvious lol?\n\nThe teams that qualified and not as financially backed and therefore the same players are oversued due to lack of depth... and also they are playing in another tournament, so instead of playing full strength squads in the league they are having to rest players in the league or vice versa.', '*Regression to the mean*?']"

433,r/PremierLeague,EzioAuditore-Evie,VAR Table vs. Non-VAR Table *After Week 1(All Matches Completed),"In this season long feature, I will be tracking the live/VAR table vs. what the table would look like if it was like last season and VAR didn’t exist. I am intrigued by how VAR may ultimately impact the final table. Soccer is a sport in which a large portion of matches end in draws and 1 goal decisions. Basically, 1 VAR decision could be critical in a team’s effort to get all 3 points or coming away with only 1 which could be huge in the table. This also changes goal differential and goals scored, which is huge obviously for teams on the same point total. Could possibly mean difference between relegation and safety. Champions League and Europa League. Won’t be perfect because teams play differently with different scorelines, but this will still be accurate in the scope of the result. Example: Week 1 Leicester Drew Wolverhampton 0-0 after a Wolves goal was disallowed. Leicester may have played differently if under the old system the goal was good, but if they weren’t good enough to score, I don’t think allowing a goal changes that. In short, I’m tracking the direct changes due to VAR. Goals taken away or given and PK’s given and taken away.

TL;DR: I believe VAR can change the final table and I’m curious just how different the table will look because of VAR.

Minor Impacts:

1.Manchester City loses 1 in GD and West Ham gains 1 after City goal disallowed. From 6-0 City win to 5-0 City win.

2.Burnley loses 1 in GD and Southampton gains 1 after Burnley goal disallowed. From 4-0 Burnley win to 3-0 Burnley win.

Major Impacts:

1.Wolverhampton loses 2 points and Leicester gains 1 after Wolves goal is disallowed. From 1-0 Wolves win to 0-0 draw.

Whilst its good that we can now avoid penalties being awarded when they shouldn't and fouls generally will be disciplined more appropriately - obviously, there will still be a level of subjectivity and opinion on some of those decisions.

But I do have a bit of a problem with VAR and offside. I've heard time and time again on TV that VAR is for ""clear and obvious errors"", and so I can understand it being used if a players a yard offside. But aren't we also supposed to give the benefit of the doubt to attacking players? What i'm saying is that there are some calls that are shockingly close, where the linesman couldn't possibly know with 100% certainty the player was offside or not. Looking at the Man City incidents yesterday for example, I'm not convinced by some of the decisions given  the contradictory nature ""clear and obvious"" and ""benefit of the doubt"".

The poem below by Francis Duggan, sums it up nicely.  Good luck to all, and if this weekend sucks, there is always next weekend.

\----------------------------

This is the football Season it is that time of year

When men in the pub talk football as they enjoy their beer

And look forward to May when one club will fly the winner's flag

The team that wins the Premiership gives their fans the right to brag.

Their wives nicknamed the footy widows their husbands at the football club

Or after work talking football with their mates down at the local pub

They take football so seriously 'tis their passion in life

The footy fan loves his football club as much as his children or his wife.

And if their team lose at the weekend they feel and look so sad

What's known as football addiction they seem to have it bad

They feel sad for their football team and the chance of three points gone

But they cheer up and look forward to next weekend's game as the working week wears on.

This is the football Season football has gone to their head

And their football scarves and beanies they even wear to bed

About their team they feel so passionate as if to them it did belong

And 'tis with delight and pride in victory that they sing the club song.

West Ham have improved their squad and have key players back from injury and have no pressure on them for this game week. 

Arsenal on the other hand are suspect in defense, even with the additions of Tierney and Luiz,  they will likely have to outscore opponents this year week in and week out.

I expect Wolves will compete for 7th again same as last year, regardless of the Europa League\n\nIn terms of who will have worse seasons than people expect:\n\n* I have a bad feeling the bubble will burst with Liverpool, they know that even though the only lost a single game last season it wasn't enough, if they lose a game early this season (say September/October) i think they will consider their title challenge over.\n* I think Villa fans really need to manage their expectations, so many you speak to or see on twitter/reddit etc. even those calling into things like TalkSport expect a top half finish minimum.. they have rebuilt their squad this summer but have limited amounts of quality in all areas, this season should be digging their claws into the league and hoping 3 other teams are worse than them and make the drop, rather than aiming for some kind of European adventure, comparing Wolves/Leicester/Everton/West Ham's squad to Villa it shows how unlikely it'll be for them to take one of those teams spots in the top half."", 'Tbh probably Norwich', 'Brighton and Newcastle imo.

&amp;#x200B;

An example:

David Luiz is going to Arsenal for £8m and he is 32.

How much would he have been worth at 22?

Probably not £8m, but certainly not as much a current 22 year old top tier defender would now be worth (hes no Maguire, but theres a benchmark of £80m)

&amp;#x200B;

Wouldnt it be interesting if there was a player out there whos price declined at a rate equal to the market increase and as a result he was always worth the same amount throughout his career!

On the heels of a massively successful Women’s World Cup earlier this year in France, interest in the women’s game is at an all-time high, and the English FA have made the decision to stream every single Women’s Super League match this season for free.

Built on a custom platform, The FA Player will also contain archived and on-demand content, as well as the broadcast of one Women’s Championship (i.e. second division) game per round. Better yet, **it will be not be region-locked, meaning that international viewing will be allowed!** (Only games that will be shown on BT Sport will be blacked out for UK viewers - Boo BT)

The only requirement for access will be to register for the platform, which is set to go live on September 2. Mobile apps for iOS and Android will also be available at that time.

One of the biggest barriers to womens’ football will have thus been removed. Up until now, simply watching the WSL was a difficult task. Now that games will be available to all, and that can only be a good thing.

505,r/PremierLeague,ncrooks11,Preview: Tottenham vs Aston Villa,"It’s the moment every Premier League fan has been waiting for, the summer transfer window is coming to a close and the 2019/2020 campaign will finally be underway! Tottenham Hotspur take on Aston Villa on Saturday, August 10th at 12:30 PM EST at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. 

There are still question marks for Tottenham on who will start this weekend as transfer rumors loom over the likes of Christian Eriksen, Danny Rose, and Toby Alderweireld. Tottenham also have injury worries and suspensions that will keep the likes of Son (suspended), Dele Alli (hamstring), and Juan Foyth (ankle) on the sidelines. Late deals for the likes of Bruno Fernades, Giovoni Lo Celso, and Ryan Sessegnon could still get over the line before the transfer window comes to a close on Thursday August 8th, but none of these players would likely feature in Saturday’s fixture. 

**Likely Line-up: Tottenham 4-2-3-1**

Goalkeeper: Hugo Lloris 

Defenders: Kyle Walker Peters, Jan Vertongen, Toby Alderweireld, Danny Rose

Midfielders: Harry Winks, Tanguy NDombele, Moussa Sissoko, Erik Lamela, Lucas Moura

Forward: Harry Kane

The midfield for Tottenham is a little shaky due to Alli and Son being unavailable and I firmly believe that Eriksen will either be sold before the game or among the substitutes if he stays. We could see Sissoko and NDombele interchange roles throughout the run of play and an ever changing diamond shape behind Kane. Lucas Morua and Harry Kane looked sharp in preseason and I hope that Lamela can carry on and stay healthy for a full season. 

**Likely Line-Up: Aston Villa 4-2-3-1**

Goalkeeper: Tom Heaton

Defenders: Frederic Guilbert, Bjorn Engels , Tyrone Mings, Matt Targett

Midfielders: John McGinn, Conor Hourihane, Jota, Jack Grealish, Anwar El Ghazi

Forward: Wesley

Aston Villa have splashed the cash this summer (£133.5m) upon their promotion into the Premier League and a few of their new signings will be thrust straight into the starting 11. Jack Grealish, once sought after by Spurs, will ultimately be the driving force behind Villa’s attack and all eyes will be on the new big-money striker Wesley. Villa have quite an up-hill battle ahead of them but could cause a problem for a Spurs side that is without some of its most creative talent.

**FPL Players to Watch**

In no particular order I believe that these are the players to keep an eye out going into GW 1. 

**TOT:** Kane (£11m), Moura (£7.5m), Lamela (£6.0m), Kyle Walker-Peters (£5.0m)

**AVL:** Grealish (£6.0m), Wesley (£6.0m)

I would consider captaining or at least assistant captaining Kane for this game due to the lack of attacking players at Tottenham’s disposal. If you want to save money on a striker to afford more quality midfielders consider taking Lucas Moura or Erik Lamela to still have a Tottenham representative for GW1. There are better options than Grealish and Wesley at £6.0m each on GW1 but I do believe they will knick at least one goal against Spurs.

**Predicted Result**

Tottenham start the season with a win at home and all 3 points while also putting multiple goals past Aston Villa. Don’t expect Villa to go down without a fight, I believe they knick a goal against Spurs but don’t quite match up in terms of quality.",self.PremierLeague,Discussion,1565222437.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/cn7nd4/preview_tottenham_vs_aston_villa/,/r/PremierLeague/comments/cn7nd4/preview_tottenham_vs_aston_villa/,8,14,14,"['McGinn will be good for more goals than Grealish this season, and you can pick him up for £0.5m less.', 'Can you do a preview for Liverpool vs norwich', 'This is an awesome post.

We now go to the Blue Half of Merseyside to take a look at Everton.

**Team Background:**

Yet again, the Toffees were dealt with a case of ""always the bridesmaid, never the bride"" last season. While their neighbors reveled in being the Kings of Europe, they missed out on European football once again, finishing 8th despite beating Chelsea, Arsenal, and Man United over the last two months.

Inconsistency was the theme of the season, as while they looked good against some teams, other times they flatter to deceive.

Manager Marco Silva has had a busy summer, with star midfielder Idrissa Gueye leaving for PSG and youngster Ademola Lookman off to Germany, he brought in reinforcements to strengthen the squad and bring in difference makers to help them get over the hump and make that return to Europe that fans have been waiting for.

**Starting XI (Formation: 4-2-3-1):**

GK: Jordan Pickford

RB: Seamus Coleman

CB: Michael Keane

CB: Yerry Mina

LB: Lucas Digne

CDM: Jean-Philippe Gbamin

CDM: Andre Gomes

LM: Richarlison

CAM: Gylfi Sigurdsson

RM: Bernard

ST: Moise Kean

**Bench:**

Jonas Lossl

Mason Holgate

Leighton Baines

Morgan Schneiderlin

Fabian Delph

Tom Davies

Theo Walcott

Dominic Calvert-Lewin

Cenk Tosun

**Squad Analysis:**

* Biggest Strength: Playmakers
   * This squad is full of skillful and athletic players who can give defenders nightmares. Richarlison is a great player who proved his doubters wrong with his goal scoring ability and athleticism, Sigurdsson is a dead-ball specialist who bounced back after a disappointing 17/18 campaign, and new signing Moise Kean is a prolific young player who thrived under pressure at Juventus; now he gets the chance to play in the Premier League spotlight. He's only 19 as well, so I'm excited to see how he develops under Marco Silva's system.
* Biggest Weakness: Consistency
   * Despite a good start last season, the Toffees faded by December, winning just 3 of their next 14 matches, and not even a late-season run of form helped them into the Europa League places. This team needs to be more consistent, as in win huge games (i.e Merseyside derby, Arsenal, Man United, etc.) while taking the teams in the bottom half of the table seriously. I'm not sure if this is a major concern, but with the amount of depth in the squad, they should address that in these opening fixtures. 

**Players to Watch:**

All eyes will be on young striker **Moise Kean.** At just 16, he broke into the Juventus first team and last season saw him playing alongside the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Paulo Dybala, and Miralem Pjanic among others; now he gets a chance to develop in English football, but whether or not he can adjust smoothly remains to be seen. 

With the loss of Gueye, the team needed to strengthen their midfield, so they brought back one of last season's top players **Andre Gomes** on a permanent deal, added **Fabian Delph** and signed **Jean-Philippe Gbamin,** who has impressed in his three seasons in the Bundesliga. 

**Richarlison** proved his 50 million transfer from Watford was no fluke, scoring twice on his debut and showing off his pace and proficient for the back of the net along the way. Aiding him in attack is **Gylfi Sigurdsson,** who can play either up front or a number 9. Either way, he excels in both roles and is also one of the best long-range specialists in the league. **Dominic Calvert-Lewin** also supports the frontline with his technical ability. 

**Michael Keane** has developed into one of the best defenders in the league and **Jordan Pickford** is a young, reliable option in goal. 

**Prediction:**

I firmly believe this is the year the Toffees get over the hump and enter European football for the first time in a while. However, there are still the likes of Liverpool, Man United, Tottenham, and Arsenal to overcome. 

In his second season, I think Marco Silva has the tactical prowess to learn from the mistakes his team made last season.  I wouldn't say this squad is Champions League Quality, but look out for them in the near future. **7th** place for me.

Now onto Crystal Palace for the next write up!

**Team Background:**

The Eagles were in no danger of relegation last season, finishing 12th and with a victory over Man City, but is once again clinging on to Wilfried Zaha by a thread as the top clubs continue to bid for his services. So far, Everton and Arsenal have been looking to acquire his services and if he does leave by the end of the transfer window, it's going to be a huge blow for Palace.

However, this does not mean that they are a one-man team. There are still some good players left in the squad who can deliver on match days.

Cast your mind back to October 2017: Palace were goalless and pointless at the time and the future was very bleak.

Then they beat Chelsea. Then they got more wins. Roy Hodgson drove back the memories of his embarrassing loss to Iceland a few years ago while in charge of the national team to spear this club into mid-table security.

Just like last season, anything can happen.

**Starting XI (Formation: 4-4-2):**

GK: Vicente Guaita

RB: Joel Ward

CB: Mamadou Sakho

CB: James Tomkins

LB: Patrick van Aanholt

RM: Andros Townsend

CM: Luka Milivojevic

CM: Cheikhou Kouyate

LM: Wilfried Zaha

ST: Christian Benteke

ST: Jordan Ayew

**Bench:**

Wayne Hennessey

Jairo Riedwald

Scott Dann

James McArthur

Jeffrey Schlupp

Max Meyer

Connor Wickham

**Squad Analysis:**

* Biggest Strength: Wilfried Zaha
   * Over the past few seasons, he's head and shoulders above all his teammates. A skilled and athletic winger who's deadly on the flanks, he has been linked to the top clubs over the last 2 seasons. Palace are demanding a massive fee to get the England-turned-Ivorian international onto another team.
   * Another reason that he is the biggest strength of this team is going to be how hard it is to replace a man of his caliber. However, seeing as they've managed to hold onto him for quite a while, it won't be as difficult as when they get sucked into the relegation battle even with his talents displayed on the field.
* Biggest Weakness: Striker Position (basically goal-scoring)
   * Losing Aaron Wan-Bisaaka dealt the defense a massive blow, but I still think the biggest weakness of this side is still upfront. Benteke and Ayew, the two strikers I've picked for the starting lineup, have scored a combined 3 goals in all competitions last season. 3 GOALS. That's a horrendous return for two men who've cracked double-digits 5 years ago. If they want to keep up with the other teams in the league, they need to bring in some attacking help in the remaining days of the transfer window.

**Players to Watch:**

The spotlight at Selhurst Park is on **Wilfried Zaha** once more. However, there is more to the team than just the tricky winger.

**Luka Milivojevic** is a jack of all trades: team captain, holding midfielder, accurate passer and penalty specialist all in one. He led the team in scoring last season; while 10 of his 12 come from the spot, he's no stranger to banging in a cracker here and there.

**Max Meyer** fell out of favor at Schalke and into Hodgson's lap on a free transfer last season. He needs to be featured more regularly if he wants to showcase his talents that made him so highly rated in the Bundesliga.

**Andros Townsend** has found his footing in the team; his passing and long-range ability are crucial to their success.

**Christian Benteke** has struggled mightily these past few seasons, but he can still score when called up and is good in the air. 

**Jairo Riedwald** is my pick for the ""Get Your S\*\*\* Together Award"". I mean, one moment he was a promising player at Ajax, the next he's rotting on the Palace bench. Regardless, I would like to see him bounce back and be more active in the team going forward. 

**Prediction:**

I originally put them in the relegation zone because this team looked weak without Zaha on paper. However, I've done some contemplating, and I now believe with Hodgson at the helm and with the right adjustments in the transfer market, they could make some noise. 

However, I predicted them to struggle last season and did not do well. This time though, with the thin squad and concerns about them signing quality players (What has Alexander Sorloth done for me lately?), I'm pretty sure that they will finish bottom half once again and even get sucked into the relegation battle if things go wrong. 

How they've managed to hang on to Zaha for quite sometime is a thing that I will not know. I'm saying **16th** and predicting that he will be sold in the January window

I hate to admit it, but I might not make it through all the teams before opening day. While it did happen last year, it was not as drastic as this one.

I still want to thank everyone for supporting this project. It's been great previewing the Premier League once again, even with writer's block and disinterest clouding my mind every day.

Leave me suggestions in the comments on what I should do next year to improve the quality of the posts.

Now we preview the next team, Chelsea.

**Team Background:**

3rd place and a Europa League win was not enough to convince Maurizio Sarri to stay at the club, as he left for Juventus once the season ended.

But the Italian manager and his ""Sarriball"" tactics was not the only big losses the Blues suffered, as Eden Hazard finally got his move to Real Madrid to become the newest Galactico. It got even worse, as a transfer ban meant they were unable to replace him until next summer.

Taking the dugout is club legend Frank Lampard, who only had one year of managerial experience at Derby County on his CV, but it was a successful one, getting the Rams to the play-off final before losing to Aston Villa. He priorities include developing young players and playing from the back, something the team hasn't gotten used to in recent years.

Still, they're one of the top clubs in Europe and a deep run in the Champions League can boost their morale, but 

**Starting XI (Formation: 4-3-3)**

GK: Kepa Arrizabalaga

RB: Cesar Azpilicueta

CB: Antonio Rudiger

CB: Andreas Christensen

LB: Marcos Alonso

CM: N'Golo Kante

CM: Jorginho

CM: Mateo Kovacic

LW: Christian Pulisic

ST: Olivier Giroud

RW: Willian

**Bench:**

Willy Caballero

David Luiz

Davide Zappacosta

Mason Mount

Tiemoue Bakayoko

Ross Barkley

Danny Drinkwater

Callum Hudson-Odoi

Pedro

Tammy Abraham

**Squad Analysis:**

* Biggest Strength: Midfield
   * Taking a look at this squad, I see their strength being in their rock-solid midfield, purely because of how deep it is. Kante's still one of the best holding midfielders in the league, Jorginho and Kovacic impressed last season, and getting by these three is going to be difficult for opposing players. What I would like to see is the other guys stepping up. Bakayoko was dreadful in his first season but did well on loan at AC Milan, Drinkwater hasn't played much, and Barkley has not yet fit into the team's system. If and when these three return to form and play effectively alongside the Kante, Jorginho and Kovacic is key to the team's success.
* Biggest Weakness: Replacing Eden Hazard
   * For seven years, Hazard was one of the best players in the Premier League. In all but one season, he was head and shoulders the most influential player in this Chelsea side. His 85 goals and 61 assists across his time at Stamford Bridge helped them to plenty of trophies, so their transfer ban cannot come at a worse time. Come the next summer window, they need to find someone who can match his skill and output, but it's ""make do with what you have"" for now and hope Christian Pulisic can fill in Hazard's role comfortably

**Players to Watch:**

With Hazard gone, the team as a whole needs to step up, especially in the attacking department. **Tammy Abraham** has proven himself to be one of the most promising strikers in England during his loan spells away from the club and with Alvaro Morata out on loan, he now has the chance to compete with **Olivier Giroud** up front. 

Speaking of young players waiting at the chance to play in the first team, Lampard brought in **Mason Mount** and **Fikayo Tomori** with him to Derby on loan last season and with the opening up of slots on the team sheet, expect them to get some game time. 

As for the more experienced players on the team, **Willian** is now the team's main provider of assists with Hazard gone. He's a good dribbler and can get by defenders well with his skill. Partnering him on the wing is American **Christian Pulisic,** who now has a heavy burden on his shoulders by replacing Hazard on the left-hand side. 

**Jorgniho** may not be playing with his old manager in the dugout, but he's a good passer who needs to provide for his teammates if he wants to become one of the team's best players.

**Kepa Arrizabalaga's** performances are starting to live up to his hefty price tag, **Callum Hudson-Odoi** is looking for game time to improve on his craft, and **Ruben Loftus-Cheek** looks to build on last season. 

**Prediction:**

This team can go either way. If Lampard can bring out the best the younger players on the team and their top guys perform at their highest level, they should challenge for top 4 once again. If they struggle early, he could be under high pressure; as a new manager in a dream job, that's the one thing you don't want.

I'm going for **4th** only because there are three teams better than them. 

I'm praying Lampard lasts the whole season.

Yes, I skipped a couple of days. I was distracted. VERY distracted.

Let's continue on with Burnley.

**Team Background:**

The European adventure turned out to be a short one for the Clarets, ending just before the group stages. While this brief stay in the Europa League did take its toll on the team on a few occasions during the season, they still finished in a semi-respectable 15th place.

It might look like the magic carpet ride of Burnley is coming to an end, but manager Sean Dyche believes that he is working with a stronger squad than last season, and with the return of Jay Rodriguez to boost the attacking options, don't count them out just yet.

This is a team with no ""great"" players, but plenty of hardworking individuals who share a common goal as one team: play to the best of their abilities. Their direct approach to football can cause problems for other teams and can help them gain surprise results. However, a perceived failure to add to the depth of the squad could see them in the relegation battle once more. 

**Starting 11 (Formation: 4-4-2)**

GK: Nick Pope

RB: Matthew Lowton

CB: James Tarkowski

CB: Ben Mee

LB: Erik Pieters

RM: Johann Berg Gudmundsson

CM: Jack Cork

CM: Jeff Hendrick

LM: Dwight McNeil

ST: Chris Wood

ST: Jay Rodriguez

**Bench:**

Joe Hart

Charlie Taylor

Ben Gibson

Robbie Brady

Steven Defour

Ashley Westwood

Ashley Barnes

Matej Vydra

**Squad Analysis:**

* Biggest Strength: Team Chemistry
   * While they're lacking in quality (lacking being a VERY subjective term), this team plays well together. Most of the core return from last season, and some were even around when they were in the Championship 4 seasons ago, so familiarity with each other and their own individual strengths and weaknesses is their biggest asset. That can spell the difference between midtable and the relegation battle. 
* Biggest Weakness: Depth
   * Now that Tom Heaton's move to Aston Villa has been confirmed, they're left with a VERY washed-up Joe Hart as deputy to Nick Pope. That's just ONE of the areas the Clarets needed to address this window, but with only 2 signings so far, I'm not sure if they did so. Trying to mix in new faces with a well-tuned squad is challenging, but keeping mostly the same squad expecting the same results is also difficult on its own. 

**Players to Watch:**

As I said before, even though Burnley aren't filled with ""superstars"", they have dependable, hardworking guys who can get the job done.

Examples include **Jack Cork, Ashley Barnes, Chris Wood,** and **Robbie Brady.** Not exactly the flashiest players you want on your team, but dependable enough to get results.

**James Tarkowski** and **Ben Mee** anchor the defense once again, while **Jay Rodriguez** returns to the club to add in goal-scoring and ability up front. 

**Dwight McNeil** is the team's most exciting young player opposing fans should look out for. A gifted and pacey winger, he became a regular last season, and at only 19 years of age, he has plenty of room to develop into one of the best players in the league.

**Prediction:**

Burnley are once again an underdog team, now without the added pressure of European football. However, their squad is still thin, not much top-tier quality has been added, and the competition has gotten tougher. I would like to say more about this team, but I fear that the bad would outweigh the good. 

Nonetheless, I'm still expecting a down season, **17th place,** and more questions about this club's future in the top flight.

[3/20: Bournemouth](https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/civkpy/the_notsoofficial_reddit_premier_league_preview/)

Up next, Brighton and Hove Albion.

**Team Background:**

The Seagulls were just okay for the first part of last season. Not bad, but not good either. The win-loss record didn't match the performances, leading to a mediocre league position heading into the new year.

However, their form completely collapsed in the second half, winning just three of their last 23, narrowly escaping relegation by two points, and costing Chris Hughton his job.

New manager Graham Potter is looking to pick up the pieces, with the team penciled in as one of the favorites for the drop. Expect them to struggle against the other teams as they try to survive for the third season running.

**Starting XI (Formation: 4-2-3-1 Wide):**

GK: Matthew Ryan

RB: Martin Montoya

CB: Lewis Dunk

CB: Shane Duffy

LB: Bernardo

CDM: Yves Bissouma

CDM: Davy Propper

LWM: Leandro Trossard

CAM: Pascal Gross

RWM: Solly March

ST: Glenn Murray

**Bench:**

David Button

Gaetan Bong

Leon Balogun

Matt Clarke

Dale Stephens

Alireza Jahanbakhsh

Jose Izquierdo

Jurgen Locadia

**Squad Analysis:**

* Biggest Strength: Defensive-Minded Players?
   * I'm not exactly sure where, as they had a better goal difference only than the teams that got relegated, and scored the fourth-least amount of goals, again only bettered than the relegated sides. I guess that their best asset is the defense, but considering they conceded 5 at Bournemouth last season, I'm not confident. Let me know in the comments what you think Brighton's best strength is.
* Biggest Weakness(es): Adjusting to a new Style of Play, and Goal Scoring
   * Chris Hughton was sacked at the end of last season, so owner Tony Bloom went with the unconventional choice of ex-Swansea manager Potter. This is only his second season managing in England, but people who knew him from his time at Ostersunds and Swansea recognize that he is no rookie. He likes to tinker with formations, not sticking to one for most of a campaign, but also is proficient in getting the best out of his players. I think my biggest concern for this team is finding a formation that fits, as well as adjusting themselves to Potter's way of playing.
   * Also, I can't see this team scoring enough goals to stay up. If Glenn Murray continues scoring, but no one's there to ease the load off him, this team can be in real trouble.

**Players to Watch:**

**Pascal Gross** has been one of the team's best players for the past two seasons. His stats last season may be down from the season before, but I expect him to dribble swiftly past the defense and set up his teammates for goals.

**Glenn Murray** is the team's top scorer last season, and has continued to defy age during his time at the Amex. However, at age 35, he isn't going to hold the forward line for much longer, especially when he begins to decline, so expect **Alireza Jahanbakhsh** to bounce back from a very disappointing debut season (where he scored 0 goals in 24 appearances across all competitions) and **Jurgen Locadia** begin to step up as a viable scoring option after showing promise last season.

On defense, **Lewis Dunk** and **Shane Duffy** are a nice pair of defenders to shore up the back, **Matthew Ryan** is a good, solid goalkeeper, and **Bernardo** can do the business from the left back spot.

**Leandro Trossard** is the big summer arrival for the Seagulls. A skillful winger who scored 22 goals in all competitions in the Belgian League last season, he's already become a key player in this squad, and if you saw him during preseason, be excited for what he brings to the table.

**Prediction:**

A struggle in one season usually leads to struggle the next, so as much as Brighton fans aren't going to like, they're going down this season.

Even though I dig the appointment of Graham Potter, who fans want to see bring out more of the attacking players not named Glenn Murray, their problems from last season will likely carry over.

This team is unpredictable, with fans expecting one of two things: another comfortable mid-table finish, or a relegation dogfight.

I really, really, REALLY hate to do this, but it's going to be **19th** place for the Seagulls.

**Current Table:**

1. &amp;#x200B;
2. &amp;#x200B;
3. &amp;#x200B;
4. &amp;#x200B;

1.City

2.United

3.Liverpool

4.Arsenal

5.Spurs

6.Everton

City’s same old, throw some money at the league and let pep work his magic, I think he’s a good manager good tactics, but city just have money so if somethings not done soon PL will turn into Serie A with Juventus and Ligue 1 with PSG, good football but not exciting since there’s no matching competition

Saying that, if city were to be decrowned, I’d might even move United up to 1st if they get there rumoured transfers of Maguire, Fernandes, Savic and now a swap deal for Dybala, they’ve looked really good, I know it’s pre season but still I think they could be venomous this season Oles tactics seem to be working, along with pogba actually looking like he’s gaining his desired form back, and AWB and Daniel James have made great starts 

Chelsea I think will have a decent season, probably loose first game to United and get some wins against lower tabled  teams but with top 6 signings I don’t think they’ll compete this year, they won’t drop drastically they’ll place 7th I guess

Everton will take Chelseas place if they get there rumoured signings I believe, recon they can take the opportunity by the balls if they get some good transfers in before it closes. 

Liverpool I think will go 3rd, I’m undecided on how it’ll go for them, I half believe that they’ll do good again but bottle at the end and come 3rd, or have a good but not good enough season and finish 3rd, yeah they won’t the champions league but that’s no excuse to say they’ll dominate really.

Arsenal and spurs 4. And 5. I recon it’ll be a London battle for Champions league

**Other teams:**

[**1/20: Arsenal**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/ci0w5z/the_notsooffical_reddit_premier_league_preview/)

[**2/20: Aston Villa**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/ciiba0/the_notsoofficial_reddit_premier_league_preview/)

First off, I would like to apologize for how the Aston Villa preview went. It looked and felt rushed, I didn't get the chance to know all the players well (THANKS A LOT WIKIPEDIA), and I was not happy with how it turned out when I posted it at 10:45 pm Manila time. Also my mind was stuck in 2015-16 when writing about Jack Grealish. He's actually quite good, so I might need to watch highlights of him before writing. 

From reading the comments, I understand that I don't know the team very well, but I managed to screw up because I was looking at base value. Not realizing John McGinn was Scottish not Irish was the least of my issues. I think I was a complete idiot when I wrote it. 

To compensate, I will look into more sources so I can also understand the teams better and no longer include who will most likely leave the club, because I don't think the people reading this will agree with my selection.

Anyway, let's look at Bournemouth.

**Team Background:**

As I stated last season, the main question for Bournemouth is: Can they keep it going?

I'm actually excited for how the Cherries are going to impress the football world once more. They're full of ambition, can get surprise results against the big clubs, and manager Eddie Howe trains his players to give their all come match day. 

Despite finishing in 14th place last season, they won't be staring at the trap door anytime soon, as a pair of new signings strengthen the back line that was weak at times, and their best players continue to improve. 

**Starting XI (Formation: 4-2-2-2)**

GK: Asmir Begovic

RB: Jack Stacey

CB: Steve Cook 

CB: Nathan Ake

LB: Lloyd Kelly

CM: Jefferson Lerma

CM: Lewis Cook

LCAM: Ryan Fraser

RCAM: David Brooks

ST: Josh King

ST: Callum Wilson

**Bench:**

Artur Boruc

Chris Mepham

Charlie Daniels (currently injured)

Diego Rico (currently injured)

Junior Stanislas

Harry Arter

Dan Gosling

Jordon Ibe

Dominic Solanke

**Squad Analysis**

* Biggest Strength: Following Eddie Howe's Style of Play
   * The story of how Eddie Howe guided this team from the brink of relegation to non-league football to the top flight and keeping them there will always be the stuff of legends. The team willingly knows what kind of football he wants them to play, knowing that it can deliver them results. His attack-minded, team-based philosophy can easily resonate with the squad, so expect them
* Biggest Weakness: Goalkeeping? If not, Squad Depth
   * Well...,Artur Boruc is 39, Mark Travers impressed last season yet is still very inexperienced, and almost all their fullbacks are injured, so adding backups is necessary. If Asmir Begovic declines, then goalkeeping can be a problem, but for now, I want to see some more fresh faces be integrated into the squad, especially from the youth team. 

**Players to Watch:**

**David Brooks** broke out last season and became one of the team's top players. Now with big clubs swarming for his services, look for him to be at his best once again. 

**Callum Wilson** and **Josh King** will lead the forward line once again, while **Jefferson Lerma** looks to build on his promising debut season. **Ryan Fraser,** who finished second in the league in assists last season, is also attracting attention from the big clubs, so look out for him to build on his successes the previous year. 

New signings **Lloyd Kelly** and **Jack Stacey** add youth and promise to a defense currently troubled by injuries to their fullbacks, while club captain **Steve Cook** once again brings in leadership and physicality to the back line. 

**Prediction:**

Personally, in spite of not watching as much games as the more dedicated football fans, I've grown to like Bournemouth. They're an underdog story in of itself, and managing to last this long in the Premier League without having the finances or notoriety as other clubs is quite amazing. 

As for this season, I'm not expecting much actually. Survival is key, but setting themselves up for future success should be the highest priority. I'm saying **14th** place once again, but with the talent in this squad, they can (and probably would) finish higher.

The next team I'm going to preview is one of the new boys, Aston Villa

**Team Background:**

All is right in the world, as Aston Villa, one of the most well-known clubs in English football, is back where they belong after defeating Frank Lampard's Derby County in the playoff final (and as a bonus, get to meet his Chelsea side this season).

Manager Dean Smith has taken the necessary steps to ensure that their stay lasts more than one season, as he made 9 new signings to strengthen his squad.

Villa fans will be excited to see their team return to the top flight, hoping to erase the memories of the last time they were there. so expect them to stay up quite comfortably.

**Starting Eleven (Formation: 4-1-4-1)**

GK: Lovre Kalinic

RB: Ahmed Elmohamady

CB: Bjorn Engels

RM: Anwar El Ghazi

ST: Wesley Moraes

**Bench:**

Orjan Nyland

Matt Targett

Kourtney Hause

James Chester

Jack Grealish

Conor Hourihane

Jota

Jonathan Kodjia

**Squad Analysis**

* Biggest Strength: Skill Players
   * This current Villa side has plenty of skillful, attack-minded players in midfield and up front. Look for this team to do well on the counter-attack and go on the offensive quite often.
* Biggest Weakness: Experience/Chemistry
   * Villa released a whole host of experienced players in the offseason, including the likes of Glenn Whelan, Alan Hutton, Mile Jedinak, and Tommy Elphick. Trying to replace them is quite tricky, but I understand that the quality of players they brought in is as important as matching the production of those who left. Chemistry is a minor issue, but how they can integrate the new signings into the lineup will spell the difference between a good season and a bad one.
* Player Most Likely to be sold: Henri Lansbury
   * Not many players in this team are actually deserving to leave the club, so I'm really stretching here. Let me know whom you think is leaving in the comments.

**Players to Watch:**

As with every team in this preview, I'm looking forward to seeing the new signings adjust to a new team (and for some of them, a new league). Striker **Wesley Moraes** has been prolific in the Belgian league, and has been praised for his aerial ability and eye for goal. **Trezeguet** is a nice, skillful winger who can either score or assist, and **Tyrone Mings** and **Anwar El Ghazi** return permanently to add depth to the squad.

I'm also interested to see who comes out on top in the goalkeeping battle. I have Croatian **Lovre Kalinic** starting, but either **Orlan Nyland** or **Jed Steer** could step in when he loses form, so I'm also looking forward to that.

**Jack Grealish** is back in the top flight, much to the dismay of the Irish population; the guy actually has some talent, and if he manages to stay out of trouble, he can be one of the team's key players.

Other key players to watch out for include new centrebacks **Bjorn Engels** and **Ezri Konsa,** Manchester City castoff **Douglas Luiz,** Spaniard **Jota,** and promising Irishman **John McGinn.**

**Prediction:**

This team is hard to predict. Usually, a newly-promoted side that spends a lot of money in the summer window would do well, but look what got Fulham last season. Then again, Aston Villa are known for doing well in some seasons and disappointing themselves and their fans in others. I would say this team is going to finish in the top half, but that would be way big of a stretch, because as is the quota for newly-promoted teams, survival is the main priority. **12th** place is where I'm putting them.

I’m not sure you’ve seen much of us so I’ll try and fill you in.\n\nIn the starting XI - 4-3-3 or 4-1-4-1 is correct. Steer has been our #1 since about February and was huge for us in the play-offs. Kalinic is currently #2 with Nyland #3. Guilbert may start over Elmohamady at right back. Mings is 100% first choice centre back, Engels will probably start alongside him (if not Konsa). Targett will start at left back. In midfield, Douglas and McGinn are correct but the other one is not. Bjarnason is nowhere near the team. He’s behind Hourihane and Lansbury in the pecking order, let alone our best player and captain, Grealish, who will obviously start in that position. Trezeguet and El Ghazi will probably be on the wings unless Jota starts. Wesley will be up front. Bench: something like Kalinic Elmohamady Konsa Hourihane Lansbury Jota Kodjia. Chester will struggle with injury and Nyland reserves.\n\n\nStrengths - I think we’ll be quite comfortable on the ball and will attempt to attack frequently. Wesley will play quite deep and look to bring our midfielders into play. Big positive is that Smith gets a full pre-season this time and we’re bringing in players that suit his style.\n\nWeakness - yes we released a lot of experienced players, but most of them hardly played under Smith. 13 of the 16 that made the pitch in the play-offs are still in the squad. The core is still there but you’re right, it’s all about whether the new players can significantly improve us.\n\n\nPlayer Most Likely to be sold - Smith rates Lansbury and if he stays fit will be in the squad. Obviously 14 players left us at the start of the summer so there won’t be many more. Bjarnason and Tshibola probably. Bree sell or loan. Kalinic or Nyland will be sold if we bring in a new keeper. Hogan may leave, maybe Kodjia if we sign another striker. A few youngsters to go on loan as well.\n\n\nPlayers to Watch - Loads of them, personally I’m most interested to see how Jota does at this level.\n\n\nPrediction - 12th is ambitious but not impossible. It’s hard to say but if pressed I’d put us about 15th. No doubt it’s all about staying up.', 'Appreciate the effort gone in here but holy smokes...probably should have spoken to some Villa fans. This desperately needs updates for accuracy, as it’s pretty clear you’re not well informed about Villa and there’s factual inaccuracies...McGinn is Scottish not Irish, and the bit about Grealish needing to stay out of trouble is probably about 3-4 years out of date, and even then that stuff was overhyped. There’s already another post advising on other areas so I won’t repeat.', 'This has to be a joke? You have Grealish on the bench wtf lol', 'Sorry mate, but this has to be the worst analysis of Aston Villa I have ever seen.\n\nYou haven’t even put our captain and best player in the team... did you look at any of our line-ups from last season?\n\nI feel like if you even took a quick glance at the team we played at Wembley it would tell you more than you already know of Villa. I honestly have no idea how you have drawn your above conclusions.\n\nI mean, not including Jack Grealish... I don’t think you have to be a Villa fan to know how highly rated he is. Gareth Southgate was watching him last season in the Championship, and he was linked to Spurs last summer with us asking for £40m, and his starring role in our 10 match winning streak was well publicised.', 'I was gonna ask if you were broken but then I saw you were a city fan so you’re probably new to the game. The sum of all your mistakes in that analysis can be found when you call McGinn an Irishman. Should probably put effort into your analysis next time and talk to an actual fan who watches the team.', 'Wait....\n\n\n\n\nWhat?', 'Just wow.\n\nI appriciate the idea but this is just wrong on multiple levels. Did you get all your info from Fifa?\n\n#Overview\nWhile I appriciate the kind words at tye start we\'re probably not going to comfortably stay up. We will stay up IMO but there\'s no obvious 3 teams that will get relegated so it\'ll be a tough fight down the bottom with God knows how many teams getting sucked in depending on their recruitment.\n\n#Starting XI\nWhile 4-1-4-1 is probably correct, we\'ll be shifting between that and a 4-3-3 (I know I\'m being pedantic) \n\n **GK:** Jed Steer  \n - While on paper Kalanic is our ""best"" keeper, Steer is the player that carried us through our massive unbeaten run and the playoffs so it\'s most likely that he\'ll get the nod here. However the is the next position the club will probably look at improving. \n\n**DEF:**\nMost likely Back 4 (Right to Left): Guilbert - Engles - Mings - Targett  \n - Looking here is why I made the FIFA claim earlier. Mings originally played as a LB but played as nothing but a CB for us last season. Guilbert we bought in Jan and loaned back to his club and he\'s looked very good so far this preseason. We\'re stacked defensivly (currently 3x RB, 5x CB and 2x LB not counting players who can play multiple roles) so Konsa, Elmo etc will be getting game time but I can\'t see anything but that back for being out ""best""\n\n**MID:**\nMost Likely Midfield (Right to Left): El-Ghazi - McGinn - Luiz - Grealish - Trezugeut  \n - It\'s not 100% certain who are wingers are going to be. Jota has been amazing this preseason, El-Ghazi and Trezeguet both probably are better on the left and there are huge questions around Green still. But when it comes to the midfield I can tell you 2 things, if they\'re fit Grealish and McGinn are on the field. They\'re our 2 most important players that make our team work (And if your a fantasy footballer, McGinn is going to be a dark horse imo)\n\n**FWD:** Wesley\n\n#Strengths and Weaknesses:\n\n**Strengths:** Yeah spot on. People really over look how defensively solid Smith made us but we will be looking to press effectively and hit teams on the break.  \n\n*Edit* I don\'t think I\'ve done us a fairness here. [McGinn\'s 2nd Goal against Charlton in Preseason](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/cij2z7/charlton_athletic_1_4_aston_villa_mcginn/) Is how I think we\'ll play. We\'ll be constantly looking at forcing other teams into making errors, whether through pressuring the opponents back line when we\'ve got the ball with clever off the ball movement or through quickly moving the ball about looking for gaps and we will press **ENDLESSLY** looking to win the ball high up the pitch and counter rapidly by attacking in numbers.\n\n**Weaknesses:** Our biggest weakness is that we\'re very reliant on the first team. I said when we\'re talking about our defense how stacked we were, but realistically Elmo, Bree, and Taylor are of suspect quality, Chester is never going to play a lot of games ever again due to injuries and Konsa and Hause are young and promising but no-one knows how they\'re going to step up. Same thing in Midfield with Grealish, Luiz and McGinn nailed on starters as Bjarnson, Lansbury, Tshibola &amp; Hourihane would shock everyone if they can make the step up from Championship quality. Finally, it\'s the same upfront with Kodjia and Hogan not really fitting the way we want to play (and probably not being good enough even if they did) We\'ve got a lot of promising youth player (Rushian Hepburn-Murphy, Kenian Davies, Jake Doyle-Hayes, Andre Green and Callum O\'Hare to name a few) but we can\'t really rely on them to keep us up. Our weakness isnt about replacing the players who left it\'s about keeping the nailed on starters fit and working well together for as long as possible, otherwise we could run into issues. \n\n#Players to Watch:\n\nStraight off the bat, **Grealish** and **McGinn** regardless of how well we do expect them to be involved in some kind of transfer saga next summer. **Targett** will get plenty of comments as he\'s relativly young, English, good going forward and plays in a position that national squad doesn\'t have a nailed on starter. Finally, **Douglas Luiz** and **Wesley** will get a lot commentators salivating because of things that happened before they got here, **Luiz** being ""The one that got away from Pep"" and **Wesleys** rags to riches history. Oh and I suppose it\'s worth pointing that in **Trezuguet** we have Egypts second best player so expect to hear his name a lot on online polls.\n\n**Most Likely to Be Sold:** **Tshibola** is a good shout to leave, same with **Kalanic** or **Nyland** We\'ll have a load of younger players leave on loan before the end of the window too I reckon', 'Mate, this needs to be burned haha\nNot-so-offical but even less accurate Jesus christ', 'This... is awful.']"

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/90w7gs/the\_notsoofiicial\_reddit\_premier\_league\_preview/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/90w7gs/the_notsoofiicial_reddit_premier_league_preview/)

Hello! Welcome to Year 2 of the Not-So-Official Premier League Preview.

Just like last year, I will take a look at each Premier League Team and predict where they're going to finish in preparation for the upcoming season.

A new feature for this year is my personal squad analysis, as I look at each club's strengths and weaknesses, and see which players could leave the club either at the end of this window or in January

Again, this will be in alphabetical order, so let's begin with Arsenal.

**Team Background:**

Last season saw some strides, with great performances mixed with horrendous ones, but winning just 2 out of their last 7 games and losing the Europa League Final to Chelsea cost them a spot in the Champions League.

Unai Emery's honeymoon period is pretty much over, as in year 2, he needs to start bringing out the best out of his players His attack is pretty good, but the defence is very shaky at times, and losing Aaron Ramsey to Juventus on a free is certainly a huge blow to the midfield.

Still, the Gunners are going to be tough to beat, and will most likely challenge for Europe again.

**Starting Eleven (Formation: 4-2-3-1)**

GK: Bernd Leno

RB: Hector Bellerin

CB: Sokratis Papastathopoulos

CB: Laurent Koscielny

LB: Nacho Monreal

CDM: Lucas Torreira

CDM: Matteo Guendouzi

RM: Henrikh Mkhitaryan

LM: Mezut Ozil

CAM: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang

ST: Alexandre Lacazette

**Bench:**

Emiliano Martinez

Sead Kolasinac

Shokdran Mustafi

Dani Ceballos

Aisnley Maitland-Niles

Granit Xhaka

Reiss Nelson

Alex Iwobi

(**UPDATE: Forgot to add second CDM. Thanks** u/hunterdev81**)**

**My Squad Analysis:**

* Looking at this team, I can see their biggest strength is in attack. Aubameyang is one of the most prolific strikers in the league, Ozil and Mkhitaryan are very quality players, and Lacazette joins them to bring in added pace, skill, and finishing ability.
* Biggest Concern: Defense
   * With William Saliba not joining until next season, Mustafi declining in his performance, and Koscielny wanting out, I see that the Gunners' biggest problem being at the back. They want to strengthen that area before the season starts, so if they pull of the Kieran Tierney signing, it will massively improve the squad.
   * Also, with both Petr Cech and David Ospina gone, they do not have a quality backup goalkeeper, so if Leno's injured, they're probably going to concede a lot of goals.
* Most Likely to be Sold: Carl Jenkinson
   * Apologies for the all-caps, but HOW IS HE STILL EMPLOYED?

**Players to Watch:**

As usual, I'm expecting big things from both **Alexandre Lacazette** and **Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.** These are two of the top strikers in the league, whether one of them leads the line or they do it together, and I can see both of them near the top of the goal-scoring charts.

**Lucas Torreira** had an amazing debut season, so expect him to continue that momentum and excellent performance in midfield.

As for young players looking to break through, I expect **Reiss Nelson** to break into the first team and play regularly (if he isn't sold). After impressing at Hoffenheim on loan, he's back with the first team and looks to be the future of the club. Other promising talent on the team include **Matteo Guendouzi**, **Eddie Nketiah,** new signing **Gabriel Martinelli,** and **Joe Willock.**

**Prediction:**

If they do not bring in reinforcements on the defensive front, I think Arsenal have almost no chance of qualifying for the Champions League. I know it's harsh, but there's an old saying: ""Defense wins Championships""; in this case, succeeding in both the league and the Europa League. They're still going to have a great season, but struggle against the top 4 while doing so. I'm saying **5th** once again.

**Current Table:**

**I messed up and used a provider that won't let me extract all the data without paying £300 so I've paid for SurveyHero instead. Please resubmit all your predictions if you used the** **~~SurveyMonkey~~** **link.** Sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember when Derren Brown pretended he could predict the lottery numbers using a hive mind? He asked a group of people to each select a line of numbers, worked out the average, and then “won” the lottery with the outcome. Good stuff, right?

Well, not really, but let’s have a go at predicting the Premier League table. I’ve seen a few memes and people moaning about those who waste their time trying to predict all 20 places, including that funny one with something like 1 you’re 2 an 3 idiot 4 if 5 you 6 try 7 to 8 predict 9 the 10 final 11 table … 20 Newcastle. Ho ho ho, very good.

If you don’t want to take part, don’t worry about it – go and have a glass of soya milk or something.

For anyone who has a bit of time of their hands and fancies being part of this – let’s call it an experiment – then fill your boots. Here’s what we’re going to do:

* Go to this website: [http://bit.ly/1920predictions](http://bit.ly/1920predictions)
* Drag each team to where you think they’ll finish (or use the dropdown boxes if you prefer)
* Submit your predictions using the green button at the bottom
* Everyone’s responses will be collated and the average predicted position of each team will be calculated.

The outcome: a group predicted final Premier League table for the 2019/20 football season.

The deadline to submit your predictions is the kick-off of the first game – 8PM on Friday 9th August 2019.

The link was also posted [Twitter](https://twitter.com/boozethis/status/1154750753292132352?s=20) yesterday and already have received a handful of responses.

For what it’s worth I will be extracting every submission and have created an algorithm to dismiss any attempt at sabotage, using average finishing positions from previous season. So if you think it’s funny to predict the three promoted teams to take up the majority of the Champions League spots, your votes won’t be included and you’ll be wasting your time.

Hopefully we can all take it seriously and can just see it as a fun way to add a tiny bit of extra enjoyment to the football season.

I hope to provide regular updates to how the predicted table is looking compared to the actual table, but that all depends on the response this whole thing engenders.

Once again, [here is the link](http://bit.ly/1920predictions) to do your predictions.

659,r/PremierLeague,iSportsAPI,Sports Data Analysis:Three Premier League New Boy to watch out," In three weeks, Premier League 2019-20 will begin. Manchester City will be back to defend their title and Liverpool will be hopeful of putting another great title challenge. Tottenham and Manchester United are busy on the transfer front. They both are expected to make more signings before the window shuts down. Chelsea, on the other hand, with their transfer ban will still be able to welcome Pulisic from Dortmund whom they signed in January. Unai Emery’s Arsenal is also pushing for a couple of signings after having signed only one player so far this summer.  


Although there haven’t been a large number of signings this summer, unlike the last season. We still have some Premier League newcomers that will excite the fans for sure. Here are three new Premier League to watch out this season, all data collects from[ iSports API](http://www.isportsapi.com/).  


**Christian Pulisic (Chelsea)**  


Pulisic was being chased by other European giants like Bayern Munich and Liverpool before Chelsea agreed to pay the asking price for the American. The winger had lost his place in Favre’s starting lineup and was willing to move to another club after a tough start to last season.  


Pulisic played just 920 minutes of football for Dortmund last season in the Bundesliga. He got only 9 starts and scored 4 goals in an overall disappointing season for the wide playmaker.   


**Daniel James (Man Utd)**  


It will be a big transition for the young winger from Championship to Premier League. It will be interesting to see how he copes with this transition. His dribbling skills and through balls will surely keep United fans excited throughout the season.  


He made 41 appearances last season and scored 6 goals. He also managed 7 assists and had an average rating of 7.  


**Tanguy NDombele (Tottenham)**  


He looks like a player who will suit Pochettino’s system at Spurs. He is a suitable replacement for Mousa Dembele as his game is quite similar to him. The Frenchman likes to dribble in the middle of the park and play some killer balls.  


Last season NDombele made 45 appearances for Lyon. He had an average rating of 6.99 and pass success rate of 89%. The midfielder also contributed with 7 assists and 1 goal.

We're alright."", 'This is the best story I heard all day', ""Speaking as an Arsenal fan I think I can give you an idea of what you're getting into:\n\nHistory:\n\n- Founded in 1886\n\n- The only team in the premier League to go a whole season without losing a game (probably the best thing we've ever done). Look up Arsenal's 03/04 Invincibles if you want to learn more.\n\n- We had (arguably) the greatest striker ever in the premier League in Thierry Henry who scored 226 goals for us. He is also 5th all time top goal scorer in the premier League and has one of the best goals per game ratio.\n\n- We have a tendency let our best players go to better teams at the peak of their powers (often for a lot less than they're worth, sometimes even for free) such as: Thierry Henry, Robin Van Persie, Cesc Fabregas, Alexis Sanchez etc. feel free to look up more\n\n- Having 30 trophies to our name, we are the 3rd most successful team in England (behind Man Utd and Liverpool)\n\n- Tottenham Hotspur are our biggest rivals after we moved from Woolwich (south of the Thames) to North London (where Tottenham are also based). To see some of the highlights of our rivalry look up 5PUR2, Emmanuel Adebayor, William Gallas, Sol Campbell\n\n- We have only been relegated from the top flight of English football once in 1912/13 and came back up the next season (but the reason we came back up is a bit dodgy so you might want to look that up)\n\n(I'm sure I'm missing loads of much bigger events but they'll be a good starting point)\n\nCurrently:\n\n- We are at a very low point in our recent history after being managed by Arsene Wenger, one of the longest ever serving managers for one club in football, for over 20 years. In the first half of Wenger's reign we were a very brilliant side led by a revolutionary manager but towards the end of his tenure it was clear he was getting a bit old and we needed a fresh set of hands to take over the club.\n\n- Since our we moved out of our old stadium (Highbury) to our new one (Emirates Stadium) in 2006 the only trophy we have managed to win is the FA cup (which is pretty good and we've won it 3 times since 2006 but I think every fan of a top club would rather win the league than a cup)\n\n- Our manager at the moment is Unai Emery who has managed us for one season taking us from finishing 5th in the Premier League in Wenger's last season to 5th in the Premier League\n\n- Our strikers are phenomenal and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored 22 goals in the league last season and won the golden boot (joint with two Liverpool players who scored the same amount as him)\n\n- Our midfield is pretty average. We lost one of our most energetic attacking players in Aaron Ramsey because our owners just didn't give him a new contract.\n\n- Mesut Özil who we signed in 2013 for £42.5m isn't performing to the best of his abilities and isn't massively in favour under Emery. But for a long time he had the best assist record by far in Europe's top 5 leagues (can't remember exact statistics but trust me he is/was brilliant)\n\n- Our defence is appalling. Although it wasn't helpful that many of our defenders were injured last season for a long time\n\n- Our LB (Kolasinac) is very good at attacking but can't defend\n\n- Our RB (Bellerin) is very good but has been injured too much so we had to play a young player (Maitland-Niles) who doesn't normally play at RB in his position for much of last season\n\n- Shkodran Mustafi is an abomination and is our worst player and can't defend for shit and the fact we haven't sold him is ludicrous (he is also a defender)\n\n- Also the only player we've signed this transfer window is a teenager from the 4th division of Italian football\n\n- We are going into our 3rd consecutive season without Champions League football (the top inter-European tournament, arguably one of the most coveted trophies in club football) but we are in the Europa League (like the champions League but with slightly worse teams)\n\n- We were in the Europa League final but got battered 4-1 by Chelsea and it was honestly an embarrassing performance (although Alex Iwobi's goal was a beauty)\n\nI think I've hit the main topics here, and again, I'm sure I've missed some really obvious things out but hopefully it gives you some paths to go down to learn some more"", 'Fate has decided for you.', 'The arsenal subreddit is r/gunners :)', 'As a Chelsea fan, I would think less of you.

Chris Wilder got promoted a mid table league 1 side whilst only spending £500k (+£1.5m net spend)

And then did it again 2 years later and got promoted to the prem with a net spend of +£5m

But other teams have done this before, you say 

Wolves were promoted from league 1 with a positive net spend, but considering that were a championship side the last season, it then took 5 new head coaches and 5 years to do it,

Nigel Adkins with Southampton was a remarkable achievement, but Southampton was in a stable financial position. 50% of Sheffield United was bought for £1 that’s right £1, after many court cases, many threats, He still did it. And Adkins did not prove himself as a miracle man, after spells at Hull, Sheffield United, etc. 
But Chris Wilder has proved himself at Northampton.

Now onto Pep, After playing for Barca B and Barca, he was very familiar with Barca fans, so it is understandable why he would manage Barca B, and eventually the first team, He made history in his first season, by wining the treble, I am not trying to play it down, but with a squad that consists of *takes deep breath* Messi, Victor Valdes, Dani Alves, Xavi, Puyol, Pique, Iniesta and Yaya Toure, Eddie Howe could have done it.

They'll be more patient with any disappointments and for once will probably back the manager over the players if it comes to that.  \n\n However Lampard is just beginning his managerial career. He's joining a team that are facing a transfer ban and have just lost their best player in years, a player that made the entire team tick. The players left at chelsea also have no ties to him or Chelsea beyond playing for the club, so they're unlikely to respect his legend status if they get fed up with him (which history suggests they will)  \n\nIf things go wrong, which I imagine they would regardless of manager, then Lampard will gain a reputation of being unable to manage at the top clubs. With only one year managerial experience he has nothing to back up his credentials apart from nearly getting promotion.  \n\nChelsea have won over the fans and bought themselves some time, Lampard has put his career in line of fire and if things go wrong, he could end up in a very bad spot job-wise."", ""I dunno but can't believe he would betray all the Man City fans and go to Chelsea"", ""only time will tell but I'm optimistic, let's go!"", 'Top 6 would be a good return this season for him considering the transfer ban and sale of their best player. Whether the board see it that way is another matter though..', ""Lampard could be a good choice and definitely fits to Chelsea of his legend status he already has there. There are two main issues I see. Yes he was successful with Derby in his first season but his managerial experience is not there yet after one season of coaching a championship side. Premier League and Champions League football is a different level. He needs time and that's the other issue. Since José arrived in 2004 they had another 14 managers (including José again). José was always their best option, when they sacked him in his second spell they didn't back him in his bad run. Even considering what he has done for the club in the past, also in his second appointment. I don't see Chelseas politics changing that quickly.\n\nYes it is a lifetime chance for Frank and he has to take it. The risks are high of failing at Chelsea but I personally (no Chelsea supporter) wish him the best of luck. He was always a good professional off and on the pitch."", ""It's 50/50 for me. It was a job that was hard for anyone to take, with the transfer ban any new manager is stuck with what they have got, someone else's team. At least with Frank and Jody coming in, they have a pair that have worked with the club before and know the young players in and around the squad. They will likely be given time to change things slowly by blooding some of those young players and be given time to do things. Although Abramovich isn't really known giving people time to find their feet, Frank's status within the club may buy him a bit more time than anyone else has been afforded."", ""I've grown a fan to this move for a few reasons\n\n1. He's a club legend and he knows the fans and the upper management. \n\n2. His assistant from derby is coming to Chelsea with him. That man ran the youth team for many years and the youth we have on loan know and trust him and he knows how to get the best from them.\n\n3. There are no expectations for this season with the ban so if he fails he has a safe net. So there is less pressure on him for his first top flight manager roll.\n\n4. His style will hey the best of the players on the Chelsea system such and Ross Barkley and RLC"", 'Chelsea is a part of his life, so I think he will be very responsible coach.']"
