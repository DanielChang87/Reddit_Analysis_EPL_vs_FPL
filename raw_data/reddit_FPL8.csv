0,r/FantasyPL,DoTheRax,Average of GW 9 is higher than the average of GW 8.,"Can someone please explain to me how this gw's average is higher than the previous gw? Despite highly owned players like Mane and Abraham exploding. Also despite returns from Burnley defenders, Mount, Lundstram, a cheeky TAA bonus in the previous gameweek, we have a higher gw average this week with literally no one who is significantly owned returning/exploding except a 5, 6, and 8 from Sterling, Lundstram and Robbo. I really don't understand the maths behind this.",self.FantasyPL,,1571732313.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dl9liy/average_of_gw_9_is_higher_than_the_average_of_gw_8/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dl9liy/average_of_gw_9_is_higher_than_the_average_of_gw_8/,10,2,2,"['The difference is only one point though, both weekends weren’t great.', 'Aguero and salah owners got screwed over.

1,r/FantasyPL,QuickyGaming,Lundstram would have scored points 34 if he was correctly categorized as a midfielder.,"These calculations will be really long, there's no real purpose in it other than to be a filler so this post doesn't get removed. Also the bonus points might have been different but I'm not sure how to calculate them.

Note: Lundstram is currently on 45 points in his current, miscategorized state.

GW 1: BOU (A) - 2 points for playing 77 minutes, 1 bonus point = 3 points

GW 2: CRY (H) - 2 points for playing 90 minutes, 5 points for 1 goal scored, 1 point for a clean sheet, -1 point for a yellow card, 3 bonus points = 10 points

GW 3: LEI (H) - 2 points for playing 90 minutes, -1 point for a yellow card = 1 point

GW 4: CHE (A) - 2 points for playing 90 minutes = 2 points

GW 5: SOU (H) - 2 points for playing 77 minutes = 2 points

GW 6: EVE (A) - 2 points for playing 90 minutes, 3 points for 1 assist, 1 point for a clean sheet, 3 bonus points = 9 points

GW 7: LIV (H) - 2 points for playing 90 minutes = 2 points

GW 8: WAT (A) - 2 points for playing 90 minutes, 1 point for a clean sheet, -1 point for a yellow card = 2 points

GW 9: ARS (H) - 2 points for playing 90 minutes, 1 point for a clean sheet = 3 points

3 + 10 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 9 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 34 points.

34 points would still make him one of the best midfield bench fodders available.

15,r/FantasyPL,chapalang,"Salah, De Bruyne , Mane and Sterling","Which 2 of the 4 would you guys pick and why?

Salah being the last 2 seasons points leader and being on pens seems to make him a must have over the others but recently hit a rough patch and has many transferring him out. However going without him makes you prone to missing out on massive hauls.

Mane seems to be similar to Salah but at a lower price point might seem more value.

De Bruyne definitely the most popular option this season, current points leader and looking like an absolute essential in City’s side. Although he didn’t return this week he still influential and was unlucky not to return despite coming off an injury.

Sterling similar to Salah, second biggest goal threat for the best side in the Premier League (up for debate), Prone to rotation though although less so then Aguero.",self.FantasyPL,Discussion,1571692557.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dl0eb6/salah_de_bruyne_mane_and_sterling/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dl0eb6/salah_de_bruyne_mane_and_sterling/,81,40,40,"[""Currently sitting on Mane, De Bruyne.

23,r/FantasyPL,aurorabortrealis,Brief discussion of Solskjaer's 3412 vs Liverpool.,"Posting this to hear people's thoughts on the Utd v Liverpool game.

I'll start by saying that any discussion may be for nought, as I'm not expecting this to become United's default formation going forward.

Solskjaer's main reason for going with 3 centre backs was so they could directly match up with Liverpool's front 3. I believe this would have been the case regardless of whether Salah played or not. 

The wingbacks (AWB and Young) were instructed to press TAA and Robertson in the attacking half, then drop in to form a back 5 in the defending half. Mctominay and Fred were fairly defensive, with their main role being to track the late runs of Wijnaldum and Henderson, and to screen the defence when dropping into 5ATB.

The front 3 didn't press too aggressively. Pereira's primary goal was to block the pass to Fabinho, in an attempt to force Liverpool to play long. In attack, they rotated well and looked to get in behind the full backs before squaring the ball, as we saw for the goal.

The strenght of the formation was the ability to man mark all over the pitch. Origi in particular struggled to find space, while Mane had a little more joy against Rojo.

The weakness of the formation was offensively. Van Dijk and Matip didn't have too many issues with Rashford and James, who had to chase a lot of balls in behind for little reward. The inability of 2/3 of the centre backs to play out from the back hindered United's attack.

AWB and Young didn't have many opportunities to get into crossing positions. Young's crossing was predictably poor. AWB seemed to hesitate before crossing a few times, which meant they were blocked. As his decision making gets better I would expect him to improve here.

As expected, Rashford and James had most of their success on the counter attack, but struggled against a set defence. From an FPL standpoint, I still worry about United's ability to score against teams who set up defensively and look to counter.

Liverpool really struggled to break down the defence, having to resort to a lot of long balls and deep crosses. Personally I was pretty disappointed that TAA wasn't more aggressive, while Robertson had a lot more success, despite going against the stronger defender. Origi spent most of his time camped on the wing, while Mane was looking to roam and get on the ball, similar to how Salah plays when healthy, but with limited success. 

Conclusion: this wall of text may be for nothing, as I don't really expect United to persist with 3 centre backs. But I thought it was interesting how it was very effective at shutting down Liverpool's attack. Remember how much Liverpool struggled against Sheffield United's back 3.

I think it's clear that Rashford needs to play either on the left or with a strike partner, and not alone up top. This formation gives him that partner, and, to a degree, the opportunity to cut in from the left and not leave the penalty box a vacuum, since he and James seemed to split towards the wings every chance they got.\n\nThings will look different, and hopefully better, with Pogba, Shaw, and Martial back to full fitness, mind. I'm curious to see how we'd function if we went with a 3-4-1-2 or a 3-4-3 more often in games. Lindelof, Maguire and Tuanzebe as the three, McT and Pogba in the middle, Shaw and AWB as the WBs, and James/Rash/Martial upfront. It's not a bad template honestly and can't be worse than we've been doing with the 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 or whatever the fuck it is we had before this.\n\nAnd the best part of it all is...

Really good analysis and food for thought.

TAA was especially frustrating trying to play long balls to Mane and Origi from deep in their own half. Everything was cut out by United’s 3 CBs. United did great to pressure early, and what Liverpool really needed to do was control the possession and try not to let the Old Trafford crowd get in their head. Instead, AWB absolutely shut down Robertson on the wing and United broke down the right two or three times with really dangerous looking attacks. Mostly by releasing James in behind Robertson.\n\nUnited seemed to tire out a lot in he second half but Liverpool could not string three passes along despite having 60+% possession. Firmino had no joy without Salah Liverpool’s only real goal threat was Mane, who was utterly neutralized except for the VAR episode. \n\nReally, the only way United we’re going to score in that game was on the counter and Liverpool played into it. The goal came from Robertson overrunning Origi and then Origi losing the ball very cheaply. \n\nI think teams have pretty much figured out Liverpool are vulnerable on the counter attack, but I can’t help but think that if Salah was fit, the game would have gone very differently.']"

Apologies if this has been answered before or if there’s a really easy way to find out and I’m just being lazy...

However, depending on circumstances, even if a player's price drops, the price one is able to sell that player at may not change.

Example. I bought Pukki for 6.8m, if was price was initially 7.1m, I could sell him for 6.9m. If his price drops to 7.0m, I can still sell for 6.9m. So when his price dropped from 7.1m to 7m I didn't need to make a quickfire decision to sell before the drop.

Edit: it's based on the premise that for evry 0.2m rise above the price paid, the selling price increases by 0.1m

48,r/FantasyPL,gongersio,Agüero?,"Seems like he isn't nailed and there might be better options like Auba. Or is it worth keeping faith in him because City score so many goals? Is Sterling potentially a better option? I've had him 3 weeks and he's been benched twice(and blanked once). I don't really know what to do with him so I wanted to hear what other people are going to do with him.






Filler:
Agüero moved to Premier League club Manchester City in July 2011 for an undisclosed fee thought to be in the region of £35 million. On the last day of his debut season with the club, he scored a 94th-minute winner against Queens Park Rangers that earned City its first league title in 44 years. At the end of the 2015–16 season, of players who had played at least two seasons in the Premier League, Agüero had the highest goals per minute ratio in the history of the competition since its formation in 1992, averaging a goal every 106 minutes, ahead of Thierry Henry.[6] He also holds the joint-record for the most goals scored in a single Premier League match – five – and the fastest to do so, in 23 minutes and 34 seconds of match time.[7] In November 2017, Agüero became Manchester City's all-time highest goal-scorer, scoring his 178th City goal against Napoli.[8] Agüero is currently the 6th highest goalscorer in Premier League history, and the highest non-European scorer in the history of the Premier League, with 170 goals in the division.

Often considered to be one of the best strikers in the world,[229] Agüero is regarded as an all-out centre forward,[230] but can also play as a second striker off another striker, which he often did at Atlético Madrid with Diego Forlán,[231] due to his passing ability, tactical intelligence, and vision, which made him a capable assist-man.[232] When asked to name the players who influenced his playing style, Agüero named former Brazilian striker Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Ronaldinho and Diego Maradona as the best players to have played the game, but said that the player who influenced his style of play the most was “the Brazilian Ronaldo”.",self.FantasyPL,Discussion,1571589108.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dkgyzb/agüero/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dkgyzb/agüero/,16,0,0,"['Pep barely ever drops aguero for home games .

49,r/FantasyPL,SebastianOwenR1,Some interesting differential picks have begun to arise.,"This is especially important for those of us looking to escape some collapsing players. Teemu Pukki for instance. 

There has been huge buzz recently around Callum Hudson-Odoi. The youngster has returned from injury, and since that return has been crucial to Chelsea’s attack, scoring once and assisting 3 times in 4 appearances (1 league cup), and could be moving into good form.

Along the lines of a Pukki replacement, you may look at premium choices like Vardy, Wilson, and Jimenez, but performing just as well recently is former Liverpool striker Danny Ings (5.9 mil), who has scored 6 and an assist across all competitions for Southampton, and earlier on in the season put one in the net against his former team (albeit off of a mindless fault from Adrian.) His fixtures are scary but will be looking up in a few weeks, and he’s proven he can score against the odds. 

A midfield option who appears to be taking the spotlight from the beloved John McGinn is his teammate Jack Grealish. Fixtures also remove some of the palatability of this option. The man has clocked 4 goals and 4 assists in competition this season. He appears to be benefiting off of a tactical change at Villa, and is playing strong, promising football. 

Another option is the steady, reliable Youri Tielemans. He proved once again yesterday that he isn’t just good for assists, and he has amazing fixtures in the future, and benefits from in form teammates. 

I know I mentioned Jimenez as a premium option earlier, but then you realize that despite starting with a 35% ownership at the start of the season, Raul Jimenez has dropped below 10%. And then immediately struck form. He scored in the Europa League match before the IB, and assisted 2 against city in Wolves’ win, before scoring the drawing penalty yesterday. His form is starting to look up, and we know that the man has points in him, evidenced by last year. 

Tomori returned some today, as did Wood, and both may be mentionable, but I’ll wait for another week. These are just some interesting inclusions i thought I’d bring up. Good luck to all, and may the point drought begone.

TL;DR: Ings, CHO, Grealish, Jimenez (yes technically a differential), Tielemans. They doing neat things. Look at em.",self.FantasyPL,Discussion,1571587224.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dkgq9b/some_interesting_differential_picks_have_begun_to/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dkgq9b/some_interesting_differential_picks_have_begun_to/,44,89,89,"[""Dear lord don't waggle the glass man Ings in front of me......fine player and ability but a brisk winter breeze might injure him as soon as I transfer him in."", 'Mate paragraphs please, this felt like one huge sentence to read', 'I really wish I had waited to do my wildcard.', 'Guilbert has also been under the radar recently. Good player.', 'They change like the wind , more concerning is Mounts minutes and Kovacic fine 2nd half performance', 'Having checked the number of points left on my bench over the past months, I can confirm that Ings gets points and also that he typically gets them against the odds.', ""Like the Jimenez pick, especially as everyone seems to be jumping on Wilson and Vardy. Think he might sneak under the radar. Big question mark is Europa League. but Wolves seem to have found a way to cope with it recently. \n\nWas in interesting reminder of Alonso's capability yesterday, only 3.5% owned and with great fixtures could be one to add to the list - but at a price. If Harvey Barnes manages to nail down a place he'd be straight into my team. Three assists and 16 points in his last three games despite only managing 180 of the 270 minutes. Would put him at eight points per 90 minutes, but even 50% of that would be great value for 5.9 and only 0.3% ownership..... But sadly he'll never nail that place."", '* I wish i had bought CHO instead of Maddison...Maddison looked not too bad and yes he´s maybe a bit more nailed on, but CHO was simply amazing.

**In Summary**

We’ve seen the effects of injuries, Champions League, Carabao Cup ties, bad performances and the international break on Pep’s thinking on this and while there may be no strong correlation there is an interesting pattern. 

- Laporte (6.3) went out vs Brighton, Pep had to adjust and forced KDB to play in a deeper role while Fernandinho would be shifted to CB as what happened vs Watford

- Playing in other competitions doesn’t always correlate into being benched in the Premier League but it did for Sterling vs Watford. He played every league game and at Shakhtar as well as for England which meant Guardiola rested him.

If there’s any pattern you notice, please respond. It took me a while after watching the Crystal Palace game to find the statistics.

70,r/FantasyPL,mikecro2,Picks and transfers the veteran managers made this week compared to sample of top 500k (GW9),"Regular feature to compare the picks of  2519  FPL veterans against a sample of about 10k teams from the top 500k. Any team in my sample of top 500k which hasn't made a transfer in last 3 weeks gets excluded.

Determination of who is a veteran manager at:  https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/cqn30q/refining_the_veteran_analysis_aka_what_is_the/ 

The  2519  veterans made  4984 transfers this GW.  268 ( 10.6 %) played their wild card.
( 67.3 % have now already played WC)

For the picks comparison, I have filtered out the low ownership (but high ratio &gt; 1.2) players (threshold is 2%). If you don't see a player below then it will be because there is not enough ownership or the ratio is not big enough.

Raw picks data saved on Google Sheets as:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pyZgfphwSCRcdFmfZtGsZvpkFDLdzMK73yLMJMBuJeQ/edit?usp=sharing

There was only one other who finished on double digits, /u/workaccount567, who scored a respectable 10 points in GW7. Team of Kepa (1), TAA (1), Son (1), Vardy (5), Dendoncker (2). They also scored joint top in GW5 with 11 points which was the first week this game started. 

You needed 7 points or more to finish in the top 10% for GW7. 

There was no Super 5's in GW8 as I did not have the time to post. Everyone has been awarded a 0 for that gameweek.

**How to Play**

* Pick 1 player from each starting position (GK, Def, Mid &amp; Fwd). You are not restricted by price but none of your players (including your bench pick) can be from the same club.

* Pick 1 bench player. Must be priced at 4.1 or below for a Goalkeeper/Defender, or 4.6 for a Midfielder/Forward. Rico is 4.2 for example and can't be picked.

If you break either of these rules you will be awarded with a 0 for the cheapest player that breaks said rules. I will post a format in the comments.

**Scoring**

You score points based on how well your players perform. For the 4 starters:

* 4-6 points awards you +1 

* 7-9 points nets you +2 

* 10 points or more is +3

For the bench player:

* +1 for 1 point, +2 for 2-3 points, and +3 for 4 points or more. 

On top of this, if one of your starters finishes the gameweek in the dream team he will net you an additional +2 points. If your bench player finishes in the dream team he will net you +7 points.

112,r/FantasyPL,Top_Claim,"Thoughts on Premiums-Sterling, Aubameyang, Aguero, Vardy, Son","Interested on the opinions for these 5 premiums. I think most of us are keeping Salah or Mane for the whole season along with KDB if healthy as of right now. Who is the next agreed premium?

Sterling- 12.1 still has great underlying stats even though hes on a lower scale for returns in comparison to Aguero and Aubameyang. Also he seems to be playing slightly wider this season and without KDB's magic there seems to be a lack of something to break down defenses from city. Also Pep roulette could strike at anytime which is always a concern unless Bsilva is in fact banned which remains unknown.

Aubameyang- 11.1 First blank of the season last gw but hit the post versus Bournemouth. Always in the mix for Arsenal, might be forced out wide left with Laca back this week or next but works well with him. Good underlying stats and less rotation, likely to play every game unless injured.

Aguero-12.2 Highest scoring forward in FPL and has appeared in every game starting or off the bench. Only one blank this season. Jesus poses a threat to his position albeit hasn't looked great in the prem compared to Aguero but maybe Pep saves Aguero for champs league. City are also at a point where they cannot afford to drop more points and with some big fixtures upcoming maybe Aguero is more nailed on as Pep will want to play his best players?

Vardy- 9.0 price tag always makes a difference in comparison saving 2.0 or 3.0 minimum. Has been clinical with his chances albeit not great attacking stats from him or Leicester in general but could that be down to their fixture difficulty at the start of the season and now with all of their upcoming green they can show what their attack can do?

Son-9.8 Spurs play Watford next but Son could be out or starting on the bench as he had a long travel from North Korea. Has looked dangerous and ready to score but can we trust Spurs currently for 9.8 if he isn't for sure going to start against one of the worst teams currently in the league?

Double up- throwing this in here for a discussion on either double pool or city if you believe they are fixture proof.

Other Premiums- Pepe, Laca, Firmino",self.FantasyPL,,1571442546.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/djpdxj/thoughts_on_premiumssterling_aubameyang_aguero/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/djpdxj/thoughts_on_premiumssterling_aubameyang_aguero/,25,14,14,"['Auba being forced out wide, he was leagues top scorer playing with Laca most of the Time so he shouldnt have problems sxoring', 'I just want Pepe to be successful. Is that too much to ask? (Non-owner)', 'I have Auba, Sterling, Mane &amp; De Bruyne so surely things work out for me...', 'In my opinion (which isn’t worth much as I’m distinctly average at fantasy football):\n\nSalah - Still the best pick on the game. Most likely to get a huge haul and in the absence of Milner is on pens.  Greedier and more clinical than Mane. Confident he will outscore Mane comfortably come the end of the season. \n\nSterling - Still a great pick and along with Salah most likely to get a huge haul even if he might have the odd blank or be rested. I’d choose him over Aguero. \n\nKDB - If fit, a must have at that price. Best footballer in the premier league. \n\nAuba - stats are good and often tempted by him but never quite willing to take the plunge. I could be wrong but seems to get few assists. Once Laca is back I can see his points dropping off slightly. That said, he will consistently score as he’s a proven goal scorer. 20+ for the season. A safe pick. \n\nAguero - I just don’t trust he will not be rested a fair amount especially as he gets older. I’d rather spend the money on Sterling who I think is more nailed. Jesus is a talent and could start to fulfill his potential soon. Injury prone. That said he is capable of hitting 4 in a game... if Pep roulette doesn’t scare you, go for it. \n\nSon - Solid pick but a bit streaky. A luxury pick. Last seasons price was a no brainer. This season I’m not sure he’s worth it. \n\nVardy - Not for me at £9million\n\nKane - I don’t have him and it scares me. He will come good and if he stays fit is the best goal scorer in the league. There’s 3 players capable of a 5 goal haul in the league in my opinion. Kane, Salah, Aguero. I think Kane is the most likely to go big in Andy Cole, Andy Shearer style.  \n\nIf Manu were to get Allegri in I’d even throw Pogba &amp; Rashford into the mix of big hitters 😂', ""Made a bit of a shuffle this week and took out Salah to bring in Aguero.  \n\nSome few weeks a season I think I have Pep's rotation figured out. It would make sense to start Aguero and rest Jesus, who's been on international duty. It would then also make sense to let Jesus play the CL and League Cup matches in between the next PL matches. Having a fit and starting Aguero for home games against Villa and Southampton would be a dream.  \n\nDreams however, often turns to nightmares, and so does my team every time I do a big reshuffle. Every season I take out someone who returns the favour with a hat trick the next game. Cue a massive Pukki/Salah weekend."", 'Maybe not as clinical then but gets himself into more positions to score. Since Salah has been at Liverpool he’s got a lot more points than Mane. So must have something on him. \nFair opinion on Aguero. I’d just personally prefer Sterling and KDB and wouldn’t wanna triple up.', ""In the end of the season Sterling will finish with higher score than KDB but I don't know whether in terms of return also. So for me the question is when he starts playing and getting points. \nI don't know actually why but I just don't believe in Vardy this season. \nSalah also seems indispensable in the end to me.""]"

Wilson is still only owned by 13.4% compared to the next lowest owned from this analysis (Auba, 28.2%).\n\n*[Stats from fantasyfootballhub members area, u/Ottoeder goalscorer odd post and FPL website.]*"", ""Form can easily change over a 2 week intl break, so that's a bit unreliable.\n\nFixture differential should be weighted more heavily, IMO.\n\nAnd Home/Away does have value."", 'How is palace almost thrice as difficult compared to Sheffield?

We are almost at the finish line but there is one final poll for you to complete before our Wildcard team is locked in. Here is how the team looks at the moment:

**[Kneejerk United (3-4-3)](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/2000323/history)**

Pope (4.6) - McGovern (4.0)

TAA (7.2) - Soyuncu (4.7) - Tomori (4.6) - Rico (4.2) - Lundstram (4.2)

Sterling (12.1) - De Bruyne (9.7 / **Y**) - Maddison (7.2) - Mount (6.7) - Cantwell (4.9 / **Y**)

Firmino (9.6) - Wilson (7.9) - Abraham (7.7)

ITB: £0.3m

**Y** = Yellow Flagged (75% chance of playing)

**Final Changes**

In the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dj9y04/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_vi_final_changes) you guys were given the opportunity to suggest any number of final changes to our Wildcard team. All valid options are included: 

**Option 1 - [Sterling to Mane](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dj9y04/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_vi_final_changes/f4334pt)**

**Option 2 - [Tomori/Soyuncu &amp; Cantwell to Tierney &amp; Dendoncker](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dj9y04/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_vi_final_changes/f4316ov)**

&gt;Tiny part of me wants us to downgrade Cantwell to a 4.4 so we can just about squeeze Kieran Tierney in as a differential gamble 

**Option 3 - [Firmino &amp; Wilson to Aubameyang &amp; King](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dj9y04/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_vi_final_changes/f444r93)**

&gt;Personally I feel Wilson to King is not a massive downgrade, but Firmino to Auba is a decent upgrade. 

**Option 4 - [Cantwell, Firmino &amp; Wilson to Mane, King &amp; Connolly](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dj9y04/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_vi_final_changes/f42wx2h)**

**Option 5 - [Tomori, Sterling, Cantwell &amp; Firmino to Lowton, Mané, Hudson-Odoi &amp; Vardy](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dj9y04/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_vi_final_changes/f44er1h)**

**Option 6 - [Pope, Rico, Sterling, Cantwell &amp; Firmino to Gazaniga, Kelly, Mane, Dendoncker &amp; Aubameyang](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dj9y04/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_vi_final_changes/f4365i2)**

**Option 7 - [Pope, Tomori, Sterling, Cantwell &amp; Firmino to Gazzaniga, Webster, Mane, Dendoncker &amp; Aubameyang](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dj9y04/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_vi_final_changes/f42s4um)**

&gt;You get coverage across all the major attacks (LIV - Mane, City - KDB, ARS - Auba, LEI - Maddison, CHE - Mount/Abraham). Firmino to Auba is a big upgrade while Mane is pretty much lateral from Sterling. Wolves have a really nice run of fixtures and Dendoncker should get a bunch of clean sheet 1 pt bonuses.

&gt;Gazza gives you a top 6 keeper for super cheap and Webster has been starting for a decent Brighton defense. In a week or two you could upgrade Gazza or Webster to a 4.5 with the remaining money. 

**Option 8 - No Changes**

131,r/FantasyPL,Mik-Hail-tal,Why KDB hasn't dropped in price.,"Because I'm bored at work and I'm reading a lot of comments on this sub that 'the FPL prices are being manipulated by the evil FPL-towers', I'd like to share my thoughts on the situation.

I don't know the algorithm that decides the price changes,nobody seems to know, but here's what I think happened. I repeat: what I think happened.

""Nobody is essential"" is a quote that some people on this sub like to spread and they are correct in this way that there will most likely always be a team you can create without that ""essential player"" and still rank OR 1. But in reality, some players are simply must-haves and KDB was proving this. 2 goals, 9 assists and 10 bps for a total of 63 points in 7 fucking games, at that pace he would break Salah's record season easily. The man is an animal and he was priced at a mere 9.500.000 to start the season so he started rising, a lot.

Mount, Abraham &amp; Pukki are the only ones with more price rises than KDB since the start of the season and they all cost +/-3.000.000 less at the moment. KDB managed to rise 5 times, even though it's harder to fit him in. On top of that he came back from a long injury, still has some injury issues right now ánd plays for the bald fraud, but still he had 5 price rises. These are facts. 

I don't know the exact numbers of what I'm about to say but what **probably** happened was this:

KDB was close to his 6th price rise the day his injury news got spread, let's say +98. After the news came out, people started selling him and he started dropping.. and dropping.. and dropping..   
He dropped all the way to -98, meaning he fell 196.  
But you need to drop all the way to -100 to drop in price so he managed to survive. The 196 is relatively low but this is because of the wildcards that notoriously happen a lot during international breaks and this time wasn't an exception. Wildcards don't affect price rises.   
So let's say for example he would've been at +50 at the time the injury news spread and this wasn't an international break so the 196 would've been a lot higher, he could've easily dropped 2 times and the conspiracy theories would've been buried.

On top of that I honestly fail to see what the FPL-towers could possibly have to gain by manipulating the price of a player, in a free to play game , by 0.1 or 0.2

Now put those tinfoil hats in the trash and acknowledge the fact that selling KDB for Mahrez, who was horrible vs Wolves and got subbed in the 59', or Son, who blanked vs Brighton and might get benched vs Watford, was in hindsight, a bad idea. No need to search for conspiracies.

TL;DR  KDB didn't drop because he was close to a price rise when the injury news leaked so had to drop around 190 to get to 1 price drop. The fact that he didn't manage to drop that deep, even though he almost made it, was because of the wildcards that notoriously happen a lot during international breaks.",self.FantasyPL,,1571421710.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/djlapj/why_kdb_hasnt_dropped_in_price/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/djlapj/why_kdb_hasnt_dropped_in_price/,54,79,79,"[""There's definitely something in the algorithm that requires much more transfers out than normal for a flagged player to drop in price."", ""&gt;I don't know the algorithm\n\nThe emphasis here should go to 'algorithm', cause that's the important word differentiating to a simple mathematical formula that everyone then goes on to assume. There could be many steps in there with many conditions that we simply don't know. It's easy to have combinations of conditions that are met only once a year or have even never been met yet, that change the thresholds for price changes, by just having enough conditions. They could even use factors in there that we do not take into account making it even more complex.\n\nThere's no point in trying to explain every such case or for people to go into conspiracy theories because we just don't have anywhere enough information/statistical sample.  \n\n  \n\nEdit: Corrected to '**simple** mathematical formula'"", 'The fun part is that people who took him out, will actually have to hurry to get him back because he will start rising again soon.', ""I'd think form affects price changes quite heavily.

In a certain way', 'Or maybe the algorithm factors in points made last X games, so a player that has been scoring a lot of points needs a lot more transfers than normal to drop in price', ""I have a suspicion that the flag colour changing could affect the transfers out needed price changes.

Similar pattern happened with Martial who also hasn't dropped.\n\nMaybe a flag change is a bit of a reset switch, but I have little substantial evidence to back that up."", 'Explain the maddison miraculous price rise.', 'maybe out of the subject maybe not but if there is no such thing as what we call it FPL gods ""towers"" who control prices WHEN NEEDED then why lovren didn\'t drop in price last season for like a 10gws?  that\'s only one example of many .']"
132,r/FantasyPL,mario1301,The Case for Janmaat,"This won't be for everyone but I've noticed his name has not been mentioned in r/FantasyPL this season so I think it's worth providing a bit of background on big Daryl.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start with the cons:

* Watford have the third worst xGA in the prem
* Second most conceded team (20 goals)
* Has only played 280 mins and hasn't produced anything offensively
* Past 3 fantasy seasons averaged around the 50pts mark
* Next 3 games:  tot, BOU, CHE,

Now with the pros:

* The geezer is £4.3m
* Started 3 out of the last 5 including 90mins in the last two games (not sure why he didn't start at the beginning of the season)
* Has the potential to grab a couple goals/assists within a season
* 3 bonus pts in his last outing

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not suggesting to start him week in week out. However, if you strategy this season is similar to mine where you are trying to fit as many big hitting mids and fwds as possible, I think he could be another way to free up some funds.

My defence consists of Rico, Lundstram, Janmaat, Soyunci and Kelly, rotating these five and praying for game time and clean sheets has freed up funds for KDB, Sterling, Mane, Vardy, Firmino and Abraham.

That £0.2m made a big difference for my wildcard and even though Watford are shit, I'm banking on my heavy hitters to make up for that.",self.FantasyPL,,1571420390.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/djl3vx/the_case_for_janmaat/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/djl3vx/the_case_for_janmaat/,25,15,15,"[""I actually started the season with Kiko in a rotation because going forward he looked to have assist potential.

What site is most accurate for this season for projecting price changes?

I used to use FISO as it gave a very helpful net transfers in/out statistic so you could see the rate of change, not just whether a player was close to a price rise or fall but not sure how accurate it is this season.

146,r/FantasyPL,pm_me_tidy_code,Picking a captain for gameweek 9 - Bayesian multilevel model,"Evening FPL,

I have posted the gameweek 9 version of my Bayesian multilevel model - now with informative priors! - [on my blog](https://mbarnfield.github.io/fpl.html). I've copied the full post here. It's a bit of a basic reintroduction to the idea behind model and how it works, with this week's results (two versions) at the end.

With the international break over, it's time to pick an FPL captain for gameweek 9. I have been running a Bayesian 'captain selection model' every week that attempts to model a captain picking logic to rank players by how good a captain they are for the upcoming gameweek. It is a multilevel model, factoring in that players are clustered within teams. I run it in [`brms`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/brms.pdf), in `R`, using data from gameweek 25 last week up to the most recent gameweek. I get these data from [vastaav](https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League). The basic syntax of the model looks like this:

`points | weights(weight) ~ player + opponent + home + minutes + (1 | mm(team_1, team_2))`

`points` is simply the amount of points a player gets each week, `player` is a vector of player names, `opponent` is a player's opponent each week, `minutes` is how many minutes a player plays each week, and the `(1 | mm(team_1, team_2))` part is the multilevel component, factoring in that some players have played for more than one team over the course of the data. `weights(weight)` assigns more weight to more recent gameweeks, essentially making it so that the most recent gameweek (8) is treated as happening 1.5 times, whereas the first gameweek in the data (gameweek 25 last season) is treated as only having happened once. This weight increases exponentially by week, with a big leap occurring between the two seasons, so that gameweek 1 this season is weighted much closer to gameweek 8 this season than it is to gameweek 38 last season.

The model is based around predicting points, because it is the player with the highest points that is the best captain choice. However, I don't claim to be building a model that optimally or accurately predicts points. The players are ranked by predicted points, but the specific points values themselves aren't particularly meaningful. It is about how well the players should be expected to do, relative to each other, before we see this week's data. What I'm seeking to do is represent a thought process I think most players go through when picking a captain, which I spoke about in my first post. Basically, I think we use the following heuristics:

1. Class: which of my players is the best?
2. Form: which of my players is on the best form?
3. Fixture: which of my players is playing the worst team?
4. Venue: which of my players are playing at home?
5. Game time: which of my players will get 90 minutes?

Sometimes, this thought process doesn't leave us with a clear captain pick. I designed this model because, using the data directly, it can work out how we would expect each player to do, given who they are, who they play for, who they're up against, where they're playing, and how many minutes they'll get. So when this thought process doesn't give us a clear answer, because for instance we might have a week where Agüero is at home against Watford and Salah is at home against Norwich, the model can give us a more objective idea of the probable performance of each player. The fixture, venue and game time are accounted for by `opponent`, `home` and `minutes`. Form is built into the model through the weights, which mean that the model assigns more weight to players' performance in more recent gameweeks. These things, and class, are relevant both at the player level and at the team level --- we want to pick good *players* who are doing well, have a good fixture, are ideally at home, and are going to get plenty of minutes, but we also want players who play for good *teams* which are on form.

Class is to an extent naturally built in by the fact that I use data back to midway through last season, but it is also relevant to how the *priors* are set in the model. The model is a function of players' average price throughout the second half of last season and so far this season. As price is determined by likely performance and ownership, the variability in the prior captures how well we would expect each player to do without seeing the data. The model listens quite a lot to these priors at the moment, because I assign them a standard deviation of only 0.5. I do this to prevent the data listening excessively to the data, in which there are still considerable anomalies that skew the estimates. This is done to factor in the fact that people generally seem to choose their captains from among the premiums, so a model of captaincy selection should favour such players unless it has very good reason not to. I'm just trying to do what we do heuristically, more mathematically.

## Results

The results of the model for this week are below. Players nearer the top are estimated to have a higher probable points value this week, so are better captain picks. Note that there is a lot of uncertainty in how these players are ranked, captured by the fact that their credible intervals (the range in which we are 95% sure, based on the data, that their points value will fall) overlap a lot. There is really no meaningful difference between Mané and Agüero. This is where, if you have other considerations or intuitions, these could sway your choice one way or the other. The implications of the international break might be relevant here, for example.

The first plot assumes players play the average amount of minutes they have played over the last five gameweeks. There is therefore some variability in the minutes here. The second plot assumes that all players whose average minutes are over 45 play 90 this week. The estimates change because some players might have one prediction based on a 60 minute appearance, and another on a 90 minute appearance. Because I model minutes, the model knows that 90 minutes usually means more points than 60 minutes. Notice the difference in how De Bruyne is ranked, for example. He is a great pick if he plays a significant proportion of the match, but his average minutes over the last five gameweeks are relatively low. I think he was also red-flagged, in which case he might not be worth the risk. Again, here, the international break might be really relevant in a way I can't model. If you're convinced that Sterling won't play 90 because he played twice, then maybe don't captain him. The model doesn't have this data, but you might.

#How to Play

You post your predictions for each fixture in the format specified (e.g. `Manchester United v Crystal Palace (2-1)`) and you are awarded points as per the following:

A correct result (e.g. 1-0) = 1 point

A correct score (e.g. 2-1) = 3 points

You will be awarded either 0, 1 or 3 points (with a maximum score of 3 points) per fixture.

So in the hypothetical fixture above, if the match ended 2-1 and you had predicted 3-2 to United, you would be awarded 1 point. 

If you predicted 2-1 to United, you would be awarded the full 3 points.

If you predicted a draw or a Palace win, you would score 0 points.

[**You can see a more detailed explanation of the rules here.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/cmvubh/predictions_league_gw1_thread/)


#GW9 Fixtures and Format

* Everton v West Ham (H-A)
* Aston Villa v Brighton (H-A)
* Bournemouth v Norwich (H-A)
* Chelsea v Newcastle (H-A)
* Leicester v Burnley (H-A)
* Spurs v Watford (H-A)
* Wolves v Southampton (H-A)
* Crystal Palace v Man City (H-A)
* Man Utd v Liverpool (H-A)
* Sheffield Utd v Arsenal (H-A)


Each prediction must be in the following format:

* `Home Team v Away Team (2-1)`

This is because /u/hi-i-am-new-here
's Excel macro expects predictions in this format and ignores everything else. 

The most important parts of each prediction are the hyphen (`-`) and the brackets (`()`). 

Please do not use colons (`:`) or other brackets because the macro is not looking for these.

The order is the next most important thing because e.g. if you post your Burnley v Southampton prediction before the Bournemouth v Sheffield Utd fixture, then the macro will take your Burnley v Southampton prediction as your Bournemouth v Sheffield Utd prediction.  

In previous seasons, predictions not fitting this format and order have been manually corrected but this will only be the case this season in very rare exceptions. You are responsible for your own predictions.

Two positions were all that were left [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/diubp2/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_v_final_2_positions). Voting was close throughout but in the end it was Maddison and Firmino who take it, just beating out Yarmolenko and Aubameyang for the final 2 places! With these two new additions we finally have our 15-man squad and all that's left to do is to give you one final say on what happens to the team before the captain and bench vote tomorrow evening.

**Final Changes**

This is it. If there is something you are not happy with or things have changed and you want to make adjustments, this will be your final opportunity to suggest any number of changes you want to make to the team. There will be a poll vote held tomorrow with the most popular options. 

Please reply directly in the comments with any changes you want. In your comment you are welcome to suggest as many changes as you like. You can include multiple transfers, formation changes and changes to bench personnel all in the same comment. Heck, change all 15 players if that's what you want. We leave it entirely in your hands. 

*Note - You have £0.3m ITB to work with and it's worth mentioning there are already 3 players from Chelsea in the team, so if you do want a different Chelsea player you will first need to take one out.*

167,r/FantasyPL,tongueinloftuscheek,I've got a problem with my TWAT and I need your help.,"You may or may not have heard that I used to do a post on this subreddit called the TWAT.

Of course, 'TWAT' is an acronym. It stands for The Worst Active Team. In a nutshell, I analysed the lowest scoring team in the top10k in any given gameweek. It won the Pulitzer Prize for literature and, perhaps even more prestigiously, was endorsed by Richard and Judy's book club. I don't want to be *that* guy but, suffice to say*,* it was a pretty big fucking deal.

Until it stopped.

But I'd like to dust her off, grease her up and get her back on the road.

I've received several requests, and even a Twitter DM from Judy herself (nudes attached).

Got one issue though - this is where you come in.

The site I used to get my data from (fpldiscovery) has ceased operations over the summer. 

Wondering if anyone knows where I might be able to find the lowest scoring manager in the top10k after each gameweek. Or if there's anyone on here with the skills to extract that data themselves.

Any help with my problemed TWAT would be appreciated.

---

In the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/di9ypo/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_iv_picking_2/), we asked you to select 2 of our 3 starting forwards. We received some very good suggestions but you guys showed the most love to **Abraham (155 votes)** and **Callum Wilson (90 votes)**. 

This leaves us with only 2 positions to fill for our wildcard team - a starting midfielder and a starting forward, both of which we will be selecting today before we move onto the final changes. 

---

Here's how we're shaping up:

**[Kneejerk United (3-4-3)](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/2000323/history)**

&gt;Pope 

&gt;TAA - Soyuncu - Tomori 

&gt;**Mid 1** - Sterling - De Bruyne - Mount

&gt;Abraham - C.Wilson - **Forward 3**

BENCH: McGovern, Cantwell, Rico, Lundstram 

#ITB: £17.1m

---

**Post your suggestions for the 2 positions directly in the comments below**. You can put forward any combination of 2 players you like as long as you **stay within the budget (£17.1m)** and **include a forward and a midfielder in your comment**. 

The most upvoted suggestion will be implemented.

201,r/FantasyPL,cokecap91,"Can Tottenham backup GK Gazzaniga (4.4) prove to be a good, cheap FPL choice for starting GK with Lloris out for a long time?","Hoping some Spurs fans, or anyone, can provide some insight into this. 

1.) I know Spurs brought back Michel Vorm, but is Gazzaniga still first choice when Lloris is out? 

2.) Also wondering how Gazzaniga has performed in the past when having to step in to cover for an injured Lloris? Anyone know if he’s ever even gotten a clean sheet for Spurs?

I know Tottenham have only kept one clean sheet so far this season, but having a cheap 4.4 GK that starts for one of the big 6 clubs sounds too good to pass up. Much like any other cheap GK, I’m thinking of picking him under the assumption that a clean sheet here and there along with the occasional save points should hopefully make him worth it.

## FPL PL CUP

It was a low scoring one even for the best of us. Looking at you Liverpool! 

### Group 1 (Arsenal, Chelsea, Spurs &amp; Norwich)

Arsenal had the highest score this week, with 57. They lead the group with 6 points, their representative is now #2 OR. No other representative managed to score 50+ points!

*Shame, Shame, Shame..*. was that a GOT quote or a Norwich Chant? If you had a bad week imagine getting 34 points while using your FREE HIT. Norwich: 0 Group Points.

 
Spuds^(W) and Chelsea^(L) both sit on three points after their clash. That will teach the Chelsea representative that nobody captains a Spurs player twice in a row and gets away with it.

### Group 2 (Brighton, Watford, Man City, Everton)  

Cause I'm Mr. Bright~~side~~ton, last time I use that joke for a while. Brighton are on cloud 6... 6 points after smacking down Man City 43-29. Everton manages to be boring in this tournament and in real life, managing a solid 0 points in the group. 

### Group 3 (Leicester, Southampton, Man Utd, Burnley)

Props to the Burnley representative, 2 weeks into the tournament and has grabbed a grand total of 66 points. Dropping from #3 OR to #194. United left dunks massive 10 point haul on the bench which would have guaranteed a place in top 5 OR. It's a competitive group.... unless of course, you support Burnley.


### Group 4 (Crystal Palace, Aston Villa, Newcastle, Wolves)

Group 4 is really a group of two. So, for now, I will call it Group 4/2. The only group where two teams are undefeated. You would expect that our Vila representative cashed in big-time of 5-1 win over Norwich. Well, you sir are wrong. McGinn hauled for 1 point. This weekend we have the leaders and losers battling it out. So keep your eyes on this group.


### Group 5 (West Ham, Sheffield Utd, Liverpool, Bournemouth)

Sheffield took some time away from the farm to score ""big"" with 41 points. Well, size is relative... amm I, right? Liverpool, the fortress, undefeated run, going to win the champos, pl, fa cup, league cup..... They scored a meager 21 POINTS. That is a game week rank of 6,499,149. shocking FROM NUMBER #3 OR. FYI, the representative didn't have a bad team. He left 26 points on the bench! Let this be a warning.

---

In the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dhucpw/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_iii_finalizing_the) we got you to select our final 2 defenders. They were starting defenders and it was not a very close vote. In fact, the two winners received 5 times as many votes as the next preferred options.  
TAA (134 votes) and Soyuncu (111 votes) complete our defence and this now only leaves 4 players to select before we can move onto final changes. 

---

Here's how we're shaping up:

**[Kneejerk United (3-4-3)](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/2000323/history)**

&gt;Pope (4.6)

&gt;TAA (7.2) - Soyuncu (4.7) - Tomori (4.6)

&gt;Mid 1 - Sterling (12.1) - De Bruyne (9.7) - Mount (6.7)

&gt;**Forward 1** - **Forward 2** - Forward 3

BENCH: McGovern (4), Cantwell (4.9), Rico (4.2), Lundstram (4.2)

ITB: £32.7m

---

So with the defence and goalkeepers out the way and 4 mids already selected, it's time we turn our focus to the front line. We'll be selecting Forward 1 and Forward 2 today, with the final forward along with the final midfielder being decided in tomorrow's post. 

At this stage there is £32.7m ITB and that is our entire budget for the final 4 starters. If you go for something like Auba (11.1) and Vardy (9) it will leave £12.6m for the final 2 positions. We're not saying that's a problem, it is entirely up to you where you spend the money, but if you do want more than budget options for the remaining positions then you'll need to keep the budget in mind when voting today as spending big now may mean certain options are not possible later.

**With all that said, please reply to our comment below with your options for Forward 1 and Forward 2. The top two options will be implemented.**

247,r/FantasyPL,404randomguy404,Kneejerk United - Wildcard Part III: Finalizing the Defense,"Welcome back to the 2019/20 edition of r/FantasyPL's hive mind team! An exercise in which you, the members of this sub, select and maintain an FPL team throughout the course of an entire footballing season.

---

In our [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dhe2rd/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_ii_the_bench_and/), we asked you to make some very important decisions for our wildcard team. Arguably the most important one was to find out what is the community's take on Salah vs Sterling. Do we want both of them, only one or neither? That was the question posed to you in our last post and the hive mind has given its decision - **Sterling stays in our wildcard team by winning the poll with 39% of the votes**. 

As for the Fodder Keeper poll, **McGovern was the clear choice with 63% of the votes**. 

We also asked you to give suggestions for a bench midfielder &amp; a bench defender. Out of all the suggestions, **Cantwell &amp; Rico were the highest upvoted ones so they both will be joining our team.** This concludes our bench with all the 3 spots filled.

---

So this is how our wildcard team is shaping up, 


[KNEEJERK UNITED](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/2000323/history)

3-4-3

&gt;Pope - McGovern

&gt;**Def 1** - **Def 2** - Tomori - Lundstram - Rico

&gt;Mid 1 - Sterling - De Bruyne - Mount - Cantwell

&gt;Fwd 1 - Fwd 2 - Fwd 3

ITB: 44.6m


---

We've got 44.6m worth of funds to play with and we're left with 6 positions yet to be filled. We figured that completing the defense first should be the best move as we expect it to not require a lot of our budget. It will also help us in getting a clearer idea about how our forward line will look like and if we can fit any premium there or in the midfield. 

So today, we are going to complete our defense by picking the 2 starting defenders for our 3 at the back formation. **Please reply to our comment below with your options for Defender 1 and Defender 2**. The 2 most upvoted suggestions will be selected for the team. 

Do keep in mind that there are still 4 starters left to pick after today so the more you save now the more will be left for these positions (Midfielder 1, Forward 1, 2 and 3) in the next posts.

255,r/FantasyPL,SimpleKancha,"[Shitpost] A Parable of The Bald Fraud, Volume VII - The Man in the FPL Towers","Previous Post in the Series: Volume VI, Viral Fraudulence https://redd.it/dgh587  

------------------------------------------------------------------------  

The pub was poorly lit and sparsely populated. At a corner table, The Bald Fraud was taking his time sipping a Bloody Mary, occasionally glancing at the entrance.  

He was waiting for a guy named Brandon, an employee at FPL Headquarters, algorithm department. He had built quite a stellar reputation for himself when it came to price manipulations, and his work behind the scenes in preventing last year's Lovren price drop was a testament to his efficiency.  

The pub door swings open and a nerdy-looking guy in glasses rushes in, scans the interior and walks towards The Bald Fraud.   

“Oh hey, Brandon. Glad that you could make it”, The Bald Fraud greets the visitor.  

“I'm on lunch-break and can't spend too much time. Have you brought what I asked for?”, Brandon pulls up a chair and plops himself down.  

“Yes, Yes; its all in here. How's work in the FPL Towers? Busy?”, The Bald Fraud passes a package in a brown envelope to Brandon.  

Brandon accepts the package and takes a peek inside.  

“This looks light, Pep. I charged Klopp 50 grand for Lovren price-lock last year and I made myself clear over the phone that KDB's would be double that. If you try to get fraudulent on me, it won't end well for you Pep. Take my word for it”, Brandon is in no mood for small talk.  

“Hey, I would never shortchange you, Brandon. Why would I? I have my mini league on line here. Half the managers in my league dropped Kevin, the greedy bastards. I can't let him go down”, The Bald Fraud defends himself.  

“I looked over the data, Pep and it doesn't look good. A lot more people are selling KDB than I thought. I have to manipulate all kinds of injury flags and what not and it still may not be enough. There are more eyes on me too, especially after I misclassified Lundstram at the start of the season. I have very real chances of getting caught this time. I can't be doing all that and also watch over you, Pep. If you fuck me over payment, I never work with you again.”, Brandon lays out the rules of the game out to The Bald Fraud.  

“You said 100 grand, I gave you that. Don't try to wriggle out of the deal now, Brandon. Maybe I sweeten the deal next time but that's all I have with me for now.”, The Bald Fraud wasn't going to be dragged into renegotiating a finalized deal.  

“Okay, okay. I didn't know it would be this tough though. I'll do my best. At worst, it could be 0.1 drop. Are you okay with it?”, Brandon wants to have some wiggle room.  

“Hell; no. No way I pay you and you still let Kevin drop. Kevin stays at 10.0 even if he fucking breaks his legs or the deal's off. Do you understand that? You don't get to fuck me and ride away into the sunset, Brandon. I'll fuck you back”, The Bald Fraud bellows.  

“Alright. Calm down. Jesus.”, Brandon is taken aback by The Bald Fraud's ferocity.  

“I don't care about Jesus's price. I just want Kevin price-locked”, The Bald Fraud gets further distressed.  

“I've got you covered, Pep. KDB's price won't fall. My break's over and I gotta get back to work. Nice doing business with you”, Brandon gets up to leave.  

“Same here, Brandon. By the way, that Lundstram thing was your masterpiece. I'm a big fan.”, The Bald Fraud, no longer upset, tries to cajole Brandon with flattery.

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

Does anyone know already if there are going to be teams playing multiple fixtures in the same gw yet or do we still have to wait for league/ fa cup matches/weather to potentially change it?,self.FantasyPL,,1571086118.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dhq3f2/double_triple_captain/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dhq3f2/double_triple_captain/,24,4,4,"[""I assume you're fairly new to FPL or at least to this sub.\n\nYou'll get a lot of tasteless jokes from this subreddit's veterans. Even the guys that were in your position last year.\n\nWhat you're proposing has been the most popular strategy for the TC chip - wait for the double fixtures, then pull the trigger. On paper, it's the most effective way to use it - much like the bench boost if you have more than 11 DGW players.\n\nPersonally have had mixed experience with a TC on a DGW as many players tend to be rotated as the tight schedule spells fatigue. A lot of people learned this with TC Sane last season while Aguero scored a handful vs Chelsea.\n\nIf you're using your TC on a DGW, be sure that your player is immune from Pep fraudulence (TC Sane intensifies) and they're not injury prone. Also make sure that it isn't snowing and they don't have the sniffles (looking at you, Kane!!!)."", ""There aren't double game weeks during the Christmas periods. There are weeks when teams play twice, but these are 2 short seperate game weeks. The double game weeks come later in the season (GW 30something) when games are rearranged due to cup games.\n\nI remember last season some people saw 2 games in a week around Christmas time and played their chips then thinking it was a DGW, make sure you're not one of these this year. When the DGW and BGWs roll around you'll definitely know about it from this sub.\n\nLiverpool/West Ham have a blank game week GW18 but the double to make up for that will be GW31/32 IIRC"", 'In my experience Bench Boost and Free Hit have been the best chips to use on double gameweeks. Double Gameweek is a great time to make up for a poor start and push for top of your ML. \n\nLast year there were three doubles. Many people used TC on Sane in the first double for a whopping 3 points. The most common chip strategy for the next two was free hit the second double, then wildcard a week before the third double and bench boost during the double while rolling a free transfer for after the double. I remember I got 137 points using the bench boost. \n\nIf you think of a double gameweek on a games played/player basis, if you use free hit you can choose 11 players who will play twice, for a total of 24 games played (captain essentially plays 4 games worth). Using bench boost after a wildcard gives you potentially 32 games played. Using triple captain gives your captain 6 games worth of points, but there’s no guarantee the rest of your team will have the double fixture. The effective games played for TC will then range from 13-26 depending on how many players have a double. It is also notoriously difficult to plan for the double gameweek as it often isn’t finalized until a week in advance. It should be pretty clear that bench boost is the ideal chip to use on a double gameweek, assuming the majority of your players actually have a double. If your triple captain blanks, you basically gained 4 points by the chip. If everyone on your bench boost blanks, you gained ~16 points with the chip (assuming all playing doubles 60+ mins etc).\n\nTriple Captain imo is best used in a plum fixture toward the end of the season, when shit teams have already been relegated. For example Norwich play away to Man City in the last match of the season this year. Depending on how the league table is, it could be a must win game for City, and they will want to utterly demolish Norwich after losing to them 3-2.\n\nOf course, like normal gameweeks, it doesn’t really pay to get too cute and outthink the meta. For example last year Brighton had a back to back double gameweek. A lot of people on here tripled up with Brighton (most common combination I think was actually Ryan, Dunk, Duffy) They lost both of the first two matches heavily and their defenders came out with like 4 points between the whole back line. It turns out that fpl is a bit like the stock market: A shitty company with an interesting product is still just a shitty company (shoutout to WeWork). \n\nTldr, the TC chip is probably the weakest chip to use on a DGW. Other chips spread the risk and value much more and enable a solid team. This is also all my opinion and I suck at fpl.', 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zKXCX4BoizwHdARVHbIYNvZr7GcE0QBNqktUiFtsjg8/edit?usp=drivesdk', ""I'd recommend Sane"", ""In addition to what everyone has said, try to ensure you follow Ben Crellin on Twitter.\n\nHe has a pretty good track record with identifying potential upcoming GWs, permutations around when etc. \n\nAs of now, there's only one confirmed blank but as we near GWs 27/28, you'll definitely start seeing some more activity around who will have the doubles and when. \n\nThe strategy on its own has given me very mixed results. The only thing last season taught was unless you plan to TC Laporte during the DGW, don't captain any other defender."", 'Good strategy.Just don’t use one of the city players as your captain. Pep will somehow make sure to rotate him out.', 'Yes. But if you think that Duffy or Dunk would be great asset at double gw, no.']"

261,r/FantasyPL,dimitros89,Wilson vs Vardy and the forwards dilemma.,"I will say the typical that this is not an RMT and believe many of us will face(or are currently facing) this dilemma soon. Deciding to have/keep Abraham in your team is an easy one. Keeping or dropping Pukki is a matter of deciding if you want to give him one more chance. Having Auba/Aguero depends on your team's formation/tactics(having Premium on top, having(or not having) Sterling/KDB etc).  Of course, another decision to make is if it's worth to go with 3 starting forwards having in mind the big variety of good choices in midfield in all price ranges.

And finally, the big selection dilemma in my opinion is Wilson or Vardy for the upcoming fixtures. I will try to share the pros of each one in respect to each other and hope to hear your opinions as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Wilson

1. Costs 1.1 mil less
2. Leaky defences in the upcoming fixtures, especially the next 2(Norwich, Watford)
3. Higher goal and expected goal involvement
4. Plays for an attacking team
5. Has better stats

Vardy

1. Is usually the focal of most of his team's goals(although Wilson has a higher contribution rate so far this year, King is expected to share goals with him).
2. Theoritically easy opponents in the upcoming fixtures and proved to be a flat track bully this year.
3. Has less BPS but gets bonus easier, probably because of having big hauls more often
4. Plays for a better team
5. Does not need many chances(or good stats) to score",self.FantasyPL,,1571069475.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dhnjop/wilson_vs_vardy_and_the_forwards_dilemma/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dhnjop/wilson_vs_vardy_and_the_forwards_dilemma/,72,50,50,"['Vardy is on pens.

 **Some clusions you can get from these tables:** 

* **Conolly** had outstanding stats against Spurs, but it was just one game. But at 4.5 he´s worth a punt...
* **Ayew** seems to be the most bargain nailed on forward, not bad for bench-fodder i think
* **Maupay** and **Wesley** have nearly the same stats, both could be good punts, but Maupay has the better fixtures
* **Wood** has better stats than **Barnes** (the reason why i have named just him)
* **Pukki´s** stats are really good, the first games he had a lot of luck, the last few he had bad luck...so i´ll stay with him for now, because he´s also very creative.
* **Haller** seems to be a good pick, his stats are nearly the same like **Aubas** (!). OK he´s not as clinical, but maybe he´s getting better ;-)
* **Abraham** seems to be a must-have. His stats are simply outstanding in his price-class! Maybe he´s the best forward in the game atm.
* **Wilson** is also not a bad pick. His stats are not as good as Abrahams but with NOR and WAT coming up the next two weeks ;-)
* **Vardy** and **Kane** are not worth their money according to the stats. Maddison´s goal threat is nearly equal to Vardy´s. So you better have a 7.2 midfielder than a 9.0 forward. Bad Spurs form affects Kane. He has to drop deep to get balls. Think the main Problem is that Eriksen has already gone in their minds and Alli is completely out of form...
* **Firmino** seems to be also a very good pick. He´s playing in a playmaker/striker-role with a lot of creativity. He may not get the golden boot, but he´ll pick up a lot of assists during the season...
* **Kun´s** stats are outstanding as you see! But it´s your decision if you want to pay 12.2m for a injury-prone player, who´s maybe get rotated with Jesus every second or third game...

272,r/FantasyPL,404randomguy404,Kneejerk United - Wildcard Part II: The Bench (and Salah vs Sterling),"Welcome back to the 2019/20 edition of r/FantasyPL's hive mind team! An exercise in which you, the members of this sub, select and maintain an FPL team throughout the course of an entire footballing season.

---

Carrying on from the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dgyqi3/kneejerk_united_wildcard_activated), we asked you to choose which players from the current team you wanted to keep. The threshold we had in mind was 10%, but this can vary depending on the amount of players you wanted to keep in the squad, and voting was close so we can't know that for certain (yet). 

The results from yesterday's poll are as follows:

**Pope (12%)** - ~~Button (5%)~~

~~VVD (2%)~~ - ~~Digne (0%)~~ - ~~Otamendi (4%)~~ - **Tomori (10%)** - **Lundstram (15%)**

~~Salah (7%)~~ - ~~Sterling (9%)~~ - **KDB (14%)** - **Mount (14%)** - ~~Dendoncker (1%)~~

~~Pukki (2%)~~ - ~~King (2%)~~ - ~~Greenwood (1%)~~

Players in bold keep their place in the squad. 

---


Keep in mind it is not a perfect system but it does give us some idea of the players you want to keep/drop. As there is no certain way to know from this if you wanted to keep the next closest, Sterling (9%) and Salah (7%), we figured we would just ask. [This was requested in the previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dgyqi3/kneejerk_united_wildcard_activated/f3h7465) and the players do take up a considerable amount of the budget so it's worth finding out from you now.

* **[Poll 1 - Salah, Sterling, Neither, Both](https://www.strawpoll.me/18782539)**

---

**The Bench**

We also asked for your preferred GK pricing structure and you decided on Budget + Fodder (76%). As Pope keeps his place in the team, all that's left to decide is the bench GK. All fodder goalkeepers have been included in the poll. They all cost £4.0m.

* **[Poll 2 - Fodder Goalkeeper](https://www.strawpoll.me/18780955)**

Finally, we move onto the outfield bench players. Based on the formation you selected in the previous post, 3-4-3 (60%), our team will have a bench comprising 2 defenders and 1 midfielder. As Lundstram is already in the team that leaves 1 defender and 1 midfielder to select. **Please reply to our comments below with your options for a Bench Defender and a Bench Midfielder**. 

The most upvoted suggestion for each position will be picked for the team.

Some clusions you can get from these tables:

* **Saka** could be outstanding if he can nail his spot (but he could be easily replaced by Lacazette, if Emery decides to play both (Laca and Auba)
* **Cantwells** stats are very good for his price bracket. Had some bad luck the last 3 games. But he gets a lot of pressure from Onel Hernandez, who comes back from injury
* **Traores** performance against city was maybe just a stray bullet...
* **CHO´s** stats are outstanding and slightly better than Mount´s, but the sample size is very bad, so be careful. And Lampard plays with 5 defenders against the tougher teams, so he could be benched. Dark horse, but could be at least as good as Mount if he can nail the spot...
* **Mount** offers still a very good value, could be a must have this season and is on the route to get about 180 points or even more...
* Be careful with **Maddison**, his stats show that he was a bit lucky with his goals so far. But his fixtures where very hard so far and now turning green...
* All of the City-Options are outstanding. Should have scored more goals and show have assisted more goal. **KDB** is simply outstanding. Offers the best value of all players if he can hold his form. Seems that **Mahrez** is now first choice on the right wing, which makes him also very tasty...
* **Salah´s** stats are just slightly better than **Mané´s**...so if you are on wildcard it´s really an option to switch, because of the money you get and the lower ownership of mane. Stats of the past also show that Mané is more clinical than Salah...the egyptian king needs  a lot of chances to score goals...

280,r/FantasyPL,aminboldi,Where to find player performance data from a certain period (GW5-Gw8),"I'm interested in seeing the FPL points scored and minutes played for players between two gameweeks.

Looking at the player ownership percentages I get the feeling that the first four gameweeks had a higher impact in our perception of the player potentials compared to the next four.

This could easily have been reversed, meaning that if the last four gameweeks were played first, instead of Pukki we would see Wesley's price sky rocket and instead of Cantwell it would be Traore as everyone's fifth midfielder.

286,r/FantasyPL,404randomguy404,Kneejerk United - Wildcard Activated!,"Welcome back to the 2019/20 edition of r/FantasyPL's hive mind team! An exercise in which you, the members of this sub, select and maintain an FPL team throughout the course of an entire footballing season.

---

It hasn't been the best of starts for Kneejerk United with the team currently placed at 1,844,028	in the overall rankings after these first 8 game weeks. So in hopes of making a much-required turnaround, the community has decided to play our first chip of the season, the wildcard. 70% of you were in favour for activating the WC in our [last poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dff5hw/kneejerk_united_gw_9_wilcard_vote/), then it clearly must be the best time for the team to change things up and create a much better squad to tackle the upcoming game weeks. As the opportunity to play our 2nd wildcard won't come till GW 20, so thinking about the long term should be an important factor while picking the team.

Let's kick things off nice and easy today. 3 polls for you to complete and then we'll get back to you tomorrow once we've had time to assess the results.

---

**Poll 1 - [Players You Want to Keep](https://www.strawpoll.me/18778817)**

 Please select all players from the current team that you would like to keep on WC. 

**Poll 2 - [Goalkeeper Combination](https://www.strawpoll.me/18778794)**

Vote for your preferred goalkeeper combination in the poll above. For the sake of simplicity, we have created three GK categories - Premium, Fodder and Budget. All possible viable combinations among them are put up into the poll for you to vote on. Please note that keepers like Schmeichel or Patricio who are priced around 5m should also be considered as budget GKs. Any keeper priced above or around 5.5m should be considered a premium GK however.

**Poll 3 - [Formation](https://www.strawpoll.me/18765440)**

Finally, if you would be so kind as to complete the formation poll above it will go a long way to helping us structure our posts for the week. The next time you will have the opportunity to change this will be during the final changes stage of the Wildcard process.

**[Kneejerk United](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/2000323/history)**


Pope (4.6) - Button (4)

VVD (6.5) - Digne (6) - Otamendi (5.5) - Tomori (4.6) - Lundstram (4.2)

Salah (12.5 / **Y**) - Sterling (12.1) - KDB (9.7 / **Y**) - Mount (6.7) - Dendoncker (4.4 / **Y**)

Pukki (7) - King (6.3) - Greenwood (4.4 / **Y**)

I would rather have a cheaper 4th mid like McGinn/Yarmolenko and go utilise that fund on forwards.\n7. Perreira : 6.1m is a bit too much for a leicester defender. If you are chasing league positions , then it makes sense to take a gamble, otherwise i can\\`t see a reason why anyone would risk that much money on Perreira , when you got so many cheaper options and good opportunity to use funds in the forward line.\n\nTo conclude, i would have minimum 2 and a maximum of 4 players from these 2 teams.\n\nTammy, Mount, Soyuncu, Maddison in that order', ""I've got 5 of them.\n\nMaddison, Soyuncu and Tammy, Mount and Tomori. They are just too good value"", 'I already have Mount and will most likely go Pukki &gt; Abraham before the deadline, other than them I can’t afford to get more because there are too many players I don’t want to drop (TAA, Robertson, KDB, Wilson, Sterling, Son at least not before Watford at home).', 'Mount, Abraham, Soy for me feel essential. After that your likely eroding your City or Liverpool positions to follow green fixtures and ignoring Bournemouth.']"

298,r/FantasyPL,julianface,Factoring in Opportunity Cost of Bench Fodder When Making Transfers,"I've been thinking hard about my 2 FTs this week and realized (better late than never) that 2 budget strikers will have an expected pay out better than having 1 striker + Van Dijk. This is mostly inspired by the point predictions on FPLreview which are the best source of expected points predictions I'm aware of. 

Anyways the point is I was mulling over whether Rico+Abraham/Wilson was better than Soyoncu/Tomori+Jimenez/Haller. In isolation it would look like the latter would be the higher points expectation BUT this is ignoring the fact that I have Lundstram and Cantwell as my 1st and 2nd subs which I imagine is also true for lots of others. So once I narrowed down my decision to Soyoncu+Jimenez vs. Rico+Abraham I had to not just consider Soyoncu vs. Rico, it was actually comparing Soyoncu as a set and forget starter vs. the best weekly matchup between Rico/Lundstram/Cantwell. When I properly considered the potential of playing 1 of these 3 fodders every week, Soyoncu was no better and thus a waste of funds. In other words the marginal gain of Abraham over Jimenez outweighs the marginal benefit of Soyoncu over 1 of Lundstram/Rico/Cantwell (which there actually isn't any). 

Something to keep in mind when you're planning your transfers.

I personally use fplreview.com to visualize fixtures across my team and plan for these scenarios', 'My bench consists of four possible players, Lundstram, Cantwell, Kelly, Greenwood. One of them(usually one of the first two) starts every week. \n\nI am between two options, downgrade Son and upgrade Greenwood or downgrade Son and upgrade Pukki. First option means i will have 3 starting strikers but will always need to bench Cantwell(or choose other mid/for, all of them 6.5 mil and above), second option means i sacrifice Pukki for one of Vardy/Wilson. \n\nI will go for second option(after GW9)  because my joy of all my three starting strikers return in a single week will not be so much once i leave 8 points on bench from Cantwell and 14 points from Lundstram..\n\nOf course, Lundstram and Kelly have difficult fixtures from now on but there will still be weeks when bench points will be high if i follow the first option.\n\nTL;DR I agree that, this year, we have a lot of good cheap bench options which are worth of starting from time to time. Going for a system which is restricting these options on the bench most of the times(e.g. three 6.0+ strikers plus Cantwell as 5th mid) will result to a high amount of lost bench points.

303,r/FantasyPL,SimpleKancha,"[Shitpost] A Parable of The Bald Fraud, Volume VI - Viral Fraudulence","Previous Post in the Series:
Volume V, Fraudoholics Anonymous - https://redd.it/daopvj  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Bald Fraud refreshed the FPL website to see what transfers Brenda Rodgers made.  

“Thank God we didn't have the early kick-off this GW or I would've been in dark when I announce my line-up.”, he thanks heavens for City's Sunday kick-off.  

The Bald Fraud sees that Brenda Rodgers sold De Bruyne for Mahrez for a one-week punt and captained him too. His eyes lit up and his overworked brain starts devising evil plans to win over the mini-league top spot back from Brenda.  

“I love it when my FPL destiny in my hands. You won't know what hit you, Brenda”, The Balf Fraud mutters under gritted teeth.  

“Riyad, Riyad; come here”, The Bald Fraud beckons Mahrez from the training pitch to the sidelines.  

“Yes Boss, What's up?”, Mahrez jogs towards The Bald Fraud. 
  
“Listen, I know you've been raring to go and score some goals but you need to look at the big picture, you know. I need you to not try to score vs Wolves. Do you get what I'm saying?”, The Bald Fraud lays it out for Mahrez.  

“Why you don't want me to score, Boss? If I'm on the pitch, I want to score.”, Mahrez is indignant.  

“No, No, No; you don't understand Riyad. I'm playing a very deep mind-game here. Haven't I always delivered the goods? Made this team better? Made you better? Trust me, you want to be playing the pass before the assist but not assists or goals. Is that clear?”, The Bald Fraud retorts, somewhat irritably.  

“Why even play me then? I'll stay home and watch.”, a baffled Mahrez presents an alternative with a furrowed forehead full of questions.  

The Bald Fraud thinks about this proposition but then shudders at the thought of Brenda's vice captain getting the captain points as well as first sub's points coming in which he had no control over. The Bald Fraud has always been afraid of things that were out of his control. He fondly remembers his sex-doll who he could make do anything he pleases and salivates at fond memories.  

“Boss, are you listening?”, Mahrez looks at The Bald Fraud who's now about to drool from the corners of his mouth.  

“Oh yes Riyad. Where was I? Ah, yes. No, I meant. You start the game and then you play the pass before the assist and go hard in the tackles, maybe enough for a yellow. In any case, I'll withdraw you at 59 minutes. And make sure you get off the field before 60 mins mark. Run if you have to.”, The Bald Fraud was counting on each point to make up the gap between him and Brenda.  

“Ok Boss. Whatever you say.”, Mahrez trots back to the training pitch wondering what just happened but decides to trust the infinite wisdom of The Bald Fraud.  

Later that night, The Bald Fraud is sitting on his bed; his sex-doll, Zlatani, on his lap and a big roulette wheel spinning in front of him; the smiling faces of all his potential starters flashing in circles before his eyes.  

But unknown to him, Jurgen Klopp had broken into his home a month ago and placed magnets under the roulette wheel slot for Otamendi. So, every time the Bald Fraud spun the wheel, it landed on Otamendi at least once. In a twist of irony, The Bald Fraud, the most accomplished fraud in the lands, was himself being defrauded. The fraudulence was going viral.

Yes, Pep roulette is still in effect, but can any city fans or people who watch City closely give an informed opinion on this as currently I believe he's used him sparingly to get adjusted to the system and is now being trusted to start games.

311,r/FantasyPL,unclebirt,Good players - Poor teams,"Anyone any ideas about buying, selling, keeping what i am describing as good players in poor teams.

In particular McGinn and Wesley of Aston Villa (15th - 8 points)      and

Dunk and Ryan of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion (14th - 9 points)

Do good players continue to play well and get individual points even though their teams do badly ?

Edit:  I thought of Pukki as soon as i had submitted the post.                  
so i thought well - even though Norwich (probably) won't get the table points that Man City do - what percentage of Norwich FPL points does Pukki get say in comparison to Man City and De Bruyne :

All players Norwich :  248 FPL points   Pukki : 54      -:  21.8%

All players Man City :   464 FPL points   De Bruyne : 63      -:  13.6%

319,r/FantasyPL,MuDelta,Few questions about historical data,"Yo, first season and I managed 45 points GW8, beating Magnus by 2, ama.

Anyway.

Has anyone taken the time to compare FPL player scores over the years and determined which formation has the most point potential? It seems clear that defenders average less, and my intuition tells me 3-5-2 is the one, but am I underestimating forwards?

Has anyone got any stories about maximising profit potential over points in the first few weeks, and is it even worth it?

Like if you continually try and preempt the herd regardless of your own ideas, you could feasibly rack up a decent amount quickly, then fill your lineup with premium players by week 25 or 30, for example. But then is it even worth it, what are the average returns for premium players Vs middle Vs budget?

Also I haven't actually watched a match this season. Obviously this is detracting from my potential. Is there a good way/decent source to get an idea of teams ratings defensively and offensively? The FDR seems a bit one dimensional.

323,r/FantasyPL,blubbersassafras,An Analysis of Overanalysis - my adventure in FPL mathematical modelling,"TL;DR: I tried making a mathematical model to predict premier league results which can be applied to predict Fantasy Football Points. It thinks you should probably have Tomori, Lundstram, TAA, Abraham and Wilson.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone! I’m a Mathematics and Statistics student experimenting with Premier League data as a computational data analysis project. For about a month now, I’ve been testing methods of analysing the accuracy of mathematical models that estimate premier league scores, and this algorithm can be applied with some effect to a larger FPL algorithm I;ve created. I want to preface this by pointing out that this post should NOT be taken as anything close to an absolute truth or a good guide for transfers by any means. There is a lot of data that I don’t have access to, and my project is arguably imperfect in several ways. It’s still a work in progress. I’m just doing it because I get off on shit like this. However, I have made some findings that could be useful in directly comparing two players and deciding which to bring in for a run of fixtures. Warning: this is long and should only be read fully if you're as bored on the IB as I clearly am.

What my method does NOT incorporate:

* Points that players lose from yellow cards
* Points keepers gain for saves made
* Bonus Point System
* Player availability in a given squad and how this can affect performances of other players, including sacking and introduction of managerial staff
* International Breaks
* The effects of resting players in prior PL games, midweek games and international fixtures
* The increased likelihood of goals being scored without an assist against clumsier defences, and vice versa.

(I really wish I could include these things but I just don’t have a detailed enough set of data to achieve this)

What my method does incorporate:

* The strength of the player’s form in goalscoring and assisting
* The strength of the player’s team’s form as well as that of their opponent, in terms of both attacking and defensive prospects.
* Points awarded for clean sheets
* Points lost for conceding two goals

&amp;#x200B;

Some interesting ""findings"":

* Tomori is the best defensive option for below 5.0mil, followed by Lundstram and Soyuncu. Chelsea are generally the 3rd best-valued team in the league with some margin over the others fighting for a CL spot.
* Callum Wilson has the highest expected points next GW at home against Norwich, because:
* Following the crushing home loss against Villa, Norwich are the worst-valued team in the league, despite being one of the 10 best sides at attacking.
* Everton and Man United are currently better than Tottenham and Arsenal, especially in defence.
* Sterling, Auba, Abraham and KDB have a higher expected points until GW13 than Salah and Mané - could the latter be worth going without?
* As of GW8, for the first time in the last calendar year Liverpool's defence is the strongest in the league.
* TAA is expected to score more points than Firmino over the next 3 games, despite being 2mil cheaper.

I would be very happy to look into anything else if anyone has any requests :)

&amp;#x200B;

This is the bit where I explain the details of my method. I don’t blame you if don’t want to read it, it gets a bit mathsy.

Over the last few weeks I’ve spent many hours tinkering around with different methods I’ve settled on the most predictively accurate I could formulate.

On a fundamental level, my method works by firstly determining four ongoing variables for each team: offensive strength at home, offensive strength away from home, defensive strength at home and defensive strength away from home.

Each of these is a numerical value, such that (mean expected goals in the premier league) x (offensive strength at home of home team) x (defensive strength away from home of away team) would give a mean expected goals value for the home team to score and thus for the away team to concede. These expected scores can be modelled as a Poisson Distribution. I explored the probability of using a zero-inflated Poisson Distribution but I was surprised to find this unnecessary. I will refer to this value as hExG (Home expected goals), and its away equivalent as aExG. For an example of estimating how many points a given player will score, I will assume that Trent Alexander-Arnold is playing away from home against Man United. The first step is to determine what proportion of the team’s strike-force that that player occupies. I found that the most accurate way to do this was to look at their last 5 games on Understat, and divide their xG by their teams’ combined xG, in those games. Trent’s xG over his last 5 games is approximately 0.86, and Liverpool’s is 11.04. So, we can assume that Trent will score a proportion of about (0.86/11.04≈)0\*\*.\*\*078 of Liverpool’s expected goals in any given fixture. Note that this does not differentiate between how well a player compares to the rest of his team at home, because I was unable to find sufficient evidence that such a differential significant enough to consider quantitively exists (e.g. Mané seems to perform better at home than Salah and worse away this season and this is leading people to choose him over Salah for good runs of home fixtures. Last season, however, the opposite was true, so we can attribute this difference to random data variance). His xA over the same period is 1.77, and Liverpool’s is 7.69, so we can guess that he will be responsible for a proportion of 0.23 of Liverpool’s expected assists. We must also take into account that only 75% of goals have an assist in the PL, so we must multiply the amount of points we expect him to score from assists by 0.75 after assuming that every goal is assisted. Since Trent is a defender, we must also give him 4 points multiplied by the probability that Liverpool will keep a clean sheet and -1 points multiplied by the probability of Liverpool conceding more than 1 goal, then multiply it by 2 for conceding more than 3 goals, and by 3 for more than 5 goals etc, both of which I determine using a python function. The formula for the points a defender scores away from home can be expressed as:

[Prob\(Clean Sheet\) = e\^\(-Opponent's Expected Goals\), due to Poisson Dist.](https://i.redd.it/bqvs5lgjsqr31.png)

If we put in the values for Trent away against Man United, this gives:

1.56 \* (6 \* 0.86 / 11.04 + 3 \* 1.77 / 7.69 \* 0.75) + 4 \* 0.32 - 0.33 + 2 = 4.5

So, on average, we can expect Trent to score approximately 4.5 points against Man United.

Through this project, after attempting to compile different statistics to determine how well a team plays in a game, I settled on simply using teams’ xG in each game – I couldn’t obtain any higher accuracy than by using this very elementary method. If you don’t know what xG is, it’s a statistic that compiles the probabilities of each shot taken by a team, based on a variety of information about the shot. The shots sum up to an ‘expected goals’ value that the team has in the game, and it has been shown that this value correlates remarkably well with goals scored. In my opinion it is the shots stat to rule all shots stats, because it determines with unique accuracy the quantitively quality of chances that players get. However, it comes with its problems: there is no way of separating penalties, which are more randomly distributed than shots in general, from other types of shots, so teams’ and especially players’ xG that have recently taken penalties will often be slightly inflated for this reason. The statistic also does not take into account how clinical strikers are, but this in my opinion is an overstated criticism. It is very rare for strikers to underperform vs their xG at a consistent rate, such as to be consistently more clinical than the typical PL striker. Indeed, the only major PL goal-scorer that I can find who has overperformed their xG by \~10%  or more than in every season they’ve played is Eden Hazard, and I’m not worried about him.

If you thought the analysis so far was boring, it’s about to get worse, as I explain how I estimate the strengths of teams. I will explain the algorithm in stages.

The first is the most basic step. As already mentioned, I create 4 datasets for each team – home and away attacking and defensive strengths. I look at the xG of each team in each game in the last 2 seasons, and append each dataset with the value divided by the average value. One can visualise this as a very spiky performance line, which I then smooth out by weighting results around a point in time using a normal distribution. To take into account the opponents’ strength, I do the same thing again but this time divide by the opponents’ strength rating as well. Then I repeat this again. And again. Etc. Eventually the values that the algorithm predicts tend towards a constant, which is my algorithm’s evaluation of the strength of each team. Or at least that’s how it works in theory – in practice the attacking numbers slowly decrease and the defensive numbers slowly decrease, but the ratio of mean attacking strength to mean defensive strength tends towards a constant, so when one multiplies the mean goals by the strength values of each team this doesn’t affect the output. I have commented my incredibly messy Python code for this section below if anyone is interested.

&amp;#x200B;

How accurate is my algorithm?

My algorithm gives the correct goal count prediction for a team about 36% of the time and gets the goal count right plus/minus one goal about 82% of the time. This doesn’t sound that impressive, but the first of those stats is 3% better than Mark Lawrenson’s predictions over the same period of time as my algorithm draws it data, so while better models surely exist, it’s not too bad. I’m also pleased with the distribution of goals the algorithm outputs, which maps quite closely to the real-life distribution.

[Graph of accuracy of goals distribution - AKA why I have opted against a zero-inflated Poisson model](https://i.redd.it/ivrmg9fltqr31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Current raw team strength evaluations (note that each of these columns is weighted a bit randomly, so should only be used for inter-team comparison rather than intra-team comparison):

&amp;#x200B;

|Team|Home Offence Strength (high is good)|Away Offence Strength (high is good)|Home Defence Strength (low is good)|Away Defence Strength (low is good)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Arsenal|1.266|1.001|1.053|1.094|
|Aston Villa|0.681|1.046|1.200|1.114|
|Bournemouth|1.188|0.844|1.272|1.222|
|Brighton|0.935|0.613|0.902|1.246|
|Burnley|0.853|0.732|1.013|1.071|
|Chelsea|1.491|1.111|0.679|0.788|
|Crystal Palace|0.909|0.822|0.930|0.995|
|Everton|1.299|0.907|1.076|0.767|
|Leicester|1.032|0.682|0.710|0.885|
|Liverpool|1.843|1.134|0.536|0.643|
|Man City|1.954|1.466|0.618|0.658|
|Man United|1.217|0.987|0.964|0.776|
|Newcastle|0.804|0.416|1.001|1.024|
|Norwich|1.313|0.606|1.826|1.530|
|Sheffield United|1.165|0.439|1.076|0.883|
|Southampton|1.140|0.786|1.209|0.965|
|Tottenham|1.078|0.837|0.998|1.004|
|Watford|1.020|0.803|1.265|1.123|
|West Ham|0.930|0.810|1.340|1.401|
|Wolves|1.033|0.903|0.932|0.765|

In order to use this data, one can multiply 1.428 (average amount of PL goals in a game) ny a team's Home/Away attacking strength by the opponent's Away/Home defensive strength to generate an expected number of goals for the team, from which you can derive odds of scores using a Poisson Distribution.

Just for fun, I've decided to calculate my team's expected points for next week:

Pope (2.27)

Tomori (4.67) TAA (4.50) Soyuncu (3.72)

Maddison (4.47) Mount (4.24) Sterling (4.91) KDB (4.46)

Auba (4.3) Abraham (4.59) Wilson (6.93 - yes, really (Norwich can't defend away from home))

Total = 49.09 without bonus pts, so better than GW8 :'(

Any constructive criticism on my method is more than welcome - it is, after all, a work in progress :)

The reason I ask is that I read a study about form recently (iirc on FPLreview). It concluded that team/player form has very weak correlation with upcoming performances (which I guess makes sense given the high variance nature of football coupled with a small sample space), whereas fixture difficulty is far more useful as a prediction tool. Would it be possible for your model to take into account a seasons worth of games instead?\n\nI’d be really interested in seeing how your model correlates with points scored over a season.\nPerhaps you could keep a running total of players FPL points against the models predictions and post a few pretty graphs later on 😜👍']"

https://i.redd.it/c0hzh5hdmqr31.png

# The Introduction

I've compiled a hypothetical Fantasy First Division All-Star Team for the 1980-81 campaign.

1980-81 was, by all imaginable means, a golden season for English football. Bob Paisley's Liverpool has gone undefeated in the European Cup, beating Oulu, Aberdeen, CSKA Sofia, Bayern and Real Madrid (1-0) in the final to lift that trophy for the third time in five years. Meanwhile, Bobby Robson's Ipswich took the UEFA Cup by storm, overcoming Aris Salonika, Bohemians Prague, Widzew, Saint-Etienne, Cologne and AZ in a dramatic, two-legged final, picking up their only European piece of silverware to date.

In the league, The Tractor Boys have unleashed truly remarkable form, losing only two of their initial 31 matches and taking what by early March 1981 looked like a commanding lead. The disaster struck at Old Trafford - after scoring a second-half equalizer, Robson's lads were sunk by a late goal from today's Pep Guardiola's co-assistant, Brian Kidd. Already struggling with the fatigue due to the lack of squad rotation and the overload of cup fixtures, Ipswich went on to lose 6 out of 9 of their remaining matches.

Aston Villa took advantage. Defeated by Town 0-1 at Portman Road and 1-2 at Villa Park, Ron Saunders' side has recovered from both of those setbacks and virtually sealed the title just eleven days after losing the latter match, when mid-table marauders Middlesbrough turned around a 0-1 deficit to beat Ipswich 2-1. Villa have won their seventh title despite using just 14 players, being eliminated from the League Cup by then-Second Division Cambridge United and... ending their FA Cup campaign after just one game, lost 0-1 to... Ipswich.

# The Team

**John Lukic** (Leeds) kept 20 clean sheets in 42 games. Along with Peter Shilton, Steve Ogrizovic and Sir Stanley Matthews, he is one of the four players to make at least one England top division appearance in four different decades. He was at Anfield when Michael Thomas went through on goal to secure Gunners the title; he also trained with David Seaman at Leeds, nine years before his former understudy replaced him in Arsenal's goal. After 668 games, Lukic has moved on to become a freelance goalkeeper coach and an after dinner speaker.

**Allan Evans** (Aston Villa) scored 7 goals and contributed to 15 clean sheets in 39 matches. His career has nearly ended at the age of 17, when he broke his leg playing for Dunfermline in a Scottish League match against Rangers. He's recovered quickly only to experience The Pars' relegation and a transition from centre-half to a forward. Despite being prolific in the latter role, Evans went down in history as a ferocious defender at Villa, making 380 appearances for the club. He now works as a successful driving instructor in Plymouth.

**Paul Hart** (Leeds) scored 4 goals and picked up 19 clean sheets in 38 appearances. The defender, remembered for his aerial prowess and an own goal, scored on his Leeds United debut, would pile up 191 appearances in five years at Elland Road. Even after The Peacocks' relegation in 1982, he'd remain loyal to the club for one more season, leaving for Forest only after ensuring that LUFC youngsters can handle his absence. Today, Hart, long-time developer of the youth talent, serves as an assistant manager at Stoke City.

**Arthur Albiston** (Man Utd) scored 1 goal and registered 17 clean sheets in 42 games. His rare, long-range strike in Manchester derby was also his first ever goal in a MU shirt despite being at the club for six years. He'd spend long fourteen seasons at Old Trafford, helping the club to dig out of the Second Division abyss in 1975 and picking up three FA Cups in 1977, 1983 and 1985. After briefly managing Droylsden, Albiston would return to his beloved United, working as a youth coach and later, as a MUTV match summarizer.

**Trevor Cherry** (Leeds) contributed to 19 clean sheets in 41 matches. The left-back from Huddersfield has joined Allan Clarke's side after being relegated with Terriers and spent ten seasons at Elland Road, remaining faithful to the club despite the 1982 relegation. Cherry has later ventured into the lower-league management and experienced the horrific, 1985 Valley Parade fire first-hand as Bradford manager. In 2004, long after leaving football for waste paper business, he was one of the unsuccessful bid makers for the emergency LUFC takeover.

**John Wark** (Ipswich) scored 18 goals in 40 games. The 23-year old was an absolute superstar of the season, winning PFA Player of the Year award as well as setting new UEFA Cup goalscoring record with 14 goals - a feat that earned him European Young Player of the Year accolade. Remembered for remarkable goalscoring instinct unusual for a central midfielder, Wark went on to win two league titles with Liverpool. He'd later be one of the first four players inducted into the Ipswich Town Hall of Fame and worked for BBC and Radio Suffolk as a pundit.

**Terry McDermott** (Liverpool) scored 13 goals in 40 matches. Early in his career, the Liverpool legend has nearly missed out on a footballing career altogether as his first club, Bury, signed him just when he thought of quitting and taking the job at wood factory. Instead, the tireless midfielder has won five First Division titles, three European Cups and one UEFA Cup, amongst lesser trophies. After hanging is boots at 36, McDermott would become an assistant manager at Newcastle, Birmingham and Huddersfield - and, currently, at Blackpool.

**Glenn Hoddle** (Tottenham) scored 12 goals in 38 appearances. Spurs' naturally two-footed playmaker, he has just picked up the PFA Young Player of the Year award the previous season and followed that up by leading his club to a tense FA Cup win, culminating with a 3-2 triumph over Manchester City in a Wembley replay. Sadly, Hoddle's illustrious, 20-year long career as a player was later overshadowed by grotesquely insensitive remarks about disabled people, costing him the England National Team job in February 1999.

**Steve Archibald** (Tottenham) scored 20 goals in 40 games. This blonde-headed forward has enjoyed a fabulous career, joining Spurs from Alex Ferguson's Aberdeen - the club with which he's won the Scottish Premier Division just prior to moving to London. Four years and 58 goals into his White Hart Lane career, Barcelona came in knocking for Archibald and he repaid that trust by winning FCB their first La Liga title in over a decade. He was last in the spotlight in 2000, after conducting a sketchy Airdrieonians FC takeover that ultimately resulted in the club's bankruptcy.

**Peter Withe** (Aston Villa) scored 20 goals in 36 appearances. His rise was a proper football fairy tale, as he's gone from playing in the Second Division for Newcastle to scoring a winning goal against Bayern in European Cup final - all in merely two years. Towering and powerful, Withe was a true journeyman, playing for South African and American clubs just prior to hitting the jackpot at Villa Park. He later continued his football journey in Asia, managing Thailand and Indonesia before settling in Perth with his wife, Kathy.

**Justin Fashanu** (Norwich) scored 19 goals in 40 matches. After wining BBC Goal of the Season award the previous season, the teenage prodigy opened new campaign with a hat-trick against Stoke and then went on to barely miss out on the Top Goalscorer award - all while playing for the club that ended up being relegated. Fashanu, later recognized as the first football professional to be openly gay, tragically took his life in 1998, following bizarre allegations of a sexual assault against him, which his suicide note deemed unjust and homophobic.

# The Trivia

* Arsenal have gone the whole season undefeated at home, with 13 wins and 8 draws. West Bromwich would've accomplished the same if it wasn't for a 0-1 loss to... Arsenal.
* Rock-bottom finishers from Palace have only managed to earn 3 points in 21 away matches, failing to win a single game on the road.
* Despite leading the table at the New Years' Eve, Liverpool had the worst league season in ten years, mainly due to 17 draws, including 2-2 at home against Palace. April streak of five games without a win has condemned The Reds to the fifth place.
* Dave Sexton was sacked by Manchester United in April 1981, when the last shred of hope for this season's silverware was lost. The head coach has departed from Old Trafford after four years in charge and without a single trophy in hand.
* Ricky Villa's [stunning solo goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQAHTCj2MA4) has sealed the FA Cup win for Tottenham. Spurs' 3-2 victory over Manchester City was just an additional drama, as it happened in a replay match, following a 1-1 draw in which City's Tommy Hutchinson scored one goal for each side.
* Third Division side Newport County has miraculously advanced to the Cup Winners' Cup quarterfinal, beating Crusaders from Northern Ireland and SK Haugar from Norway before narrowly losing to East Germany's Carl-Zeiss Jena.

I did have Cantwell but I played my first Wildcard yesterday and brought in Guen instead. I had Cantwell for a long time, and figured I may as well collect my earned profit now, rather than risk him dropping further if Norwich continue to perform poorly. Arsenal have problems but they are definitely the stronger team in midfield and going forward, and I can definitely see Guendouzi collecting assists here and there as well as (hopefully) a goal or two.

Who is the better option? 

Edit: Thanks for all your responses. Cantwell is definitely better stat-wise, but I’ve got a gut feeling about Guendo, so I’m sticking with him for now.

Obviously the projected points for this year are very high because of the ***very*** small sample size of 8 weeks, and I don't expect them to finish anywhere close to their projections, except maybe Lundstram. Its still interesting to see how well bench fodder has done in the past. Also, this doesn't take into account the introduction and tinkering with the bonus points system, which would no doubt boost some of the older seasons scores.

A very mixed one for us points-wise, enough that I can\'t tell just by looking if we\'ve done better or worse than last time - about a point and a half worse on average, it turns out. \n\nAlmost every team moved this weekend, with Liverpool now an impressive eight points ahead of second. The top few spots are currently occupied by some of the minority (about a fifth of us) who had them above City - sounds obvious, but that hasn\'t necessarily been the case in previous weeks.\n\nAs with last season, I\'m colouring things in green or tan to show if they\'ve got better or worse. Plenty of both this time, for a change. Also as before, the ""5s"", ""4s"" etc. columns are the tie breakers (relevant numbers in bold black, unused ones in grey) to separate those equal on points.

358,r/FantasyPL,GB_84,Pukki: Is it a Trybull thing?,"Like many on here I'm tossing up whether to leave the Pukki Party and thinking it Cantwell go on, can it?

Splitting the season to date in half, Pukki scored 6 attacking returns in the first 4 games and only 2 in the second set of 4 games.  Looking at the eXpected stats for the two periods, however, show it neck and neck:

**GW 1-4  vs GW 5-8**

* xG 1.55 vs 1.77
* xA 0.87 vs 0.74
* xGI 2.42 vs 2.51

What is different now for Pukki is that, from one period to the next:

* He's getting more of the ball &gt;&gt; minutes per pass received have reduced from 7.4 to 5.8
* He's creating more &gt;&gt; minutes per chance created are better at 51 compared to 88
* His average position is further forward
* His passes received heatmap looks like he is receiving the ball more centrally
* But... he's shooting less frequently &gt;&gt; minutes per attempt are down from 25.2 to 35.4; and
* His shooting has been left side dominant &gt;&gt; in the first 4 GWs he managed 4 shots on target from inside the box on the right side of goal, however none in the most recent 4 GWs

Looking back at the Norwich line-ups I can see that the preferred midfield pairing during Pukki's domination in GW2-4 was Mo Leitner and Tom Trybull.  Trybull, however, has been out with an ankle injury for GWs 5-8.  FPL has him listed as expected back 19 October 2019 in time for GW9.

Now, although Trybull wasn't around for Norwich's defeat of City in GW5, is there something missing from their game particularly these last few GWs that his return might resolve?  Norwich fans, looking for your esteemed wisdom here.

EDIT: There's a definite change in their recoveries heatmap. Predominantly at left midfield in GWs 1-4 but further back (say right back) in GWs 5-8.",self.FantasyPL,Analysis,1570661987.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dfi8gu/pukki_is_it_a_trybull_thing/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dfi8gu/pukki_is_it_a_trybull_thing/,44,122,122,"[""You Pukki bastards made C.

Tettey played vs City with Trybull out &amp; we won - then went off injured early vs Burnley and it’s gone downhill since. Hopefully we get one of them back, or Hanley with Amadou moving into midfield.', 'Good post and research, the kind of content I am looking for in this sub.', ""Injuries in the CB &amp; DM department have caused big issues along with fullbacks playing with injuries but having to rely on McGovern has also lowered the quality of the team. McGovern simply doesn't inspire confidence in the backline and is terrible at passing/kicking which leads to giving the ball away too quickly, which doesn't help a team that is used to building play from the back.\n\nThe lack of fit Centre-Backs and holding mids has left us playing Amadou at CB and while he does add physicality to the team his ball playing ability isn't currently up to scratch yet again affecting build up play. In midfield we are left playing Leitner &amp; McClean, and whilst McClean is pretty good in the air for his size they simply lack the physicality to match stronger players and can be easily overrun in midfield like what happened against Villa at the weekend, Wesley was winning almost every ball and was dragging two or three players over to deal with him. \n\n\nNorwich have really struggled against stronger better defensively organised teams such as Burnley, Palace and Villa but I can see them playing better against passing teams such as Bournemouth. \n\nHopefully when Krul comes back he can organise the defence and with another fit centre-back Amadou can join the midfield to give the creative players more freedom to attack."", ""Nah.

381,r/FantasyPL,valimo,Gazzaniga &amp; Roberto - 4.4 GK pair for the rest of 2019?,"With the injuries of Fabianski and Lloris, we have two new 4.4 keepers rising! **Gazzaniga and Roberto**

Both of the keepers should be nailed at least for the next eleven GWs, which makes them attractive options either individually or even rotated. To pump the cliches out, there in every crisis there is an opportunity.

Now here is the catch: Neither Spurs or West Ham have been defensively very convincing. Fabianski had 3 CS's and he is considered also a great keeper in terms of shots stopped. Two of these came against the newly promoted teams and one against struggling ManU. Spurs and Lloris had only one CS during this period. However, West Ham has been heavily overperforming their xCS and Spurs underperforming as [per excellent research done](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/deh7cf/expected_vs_actual_clean_sheets_gw_18/) by u/cb603. Hence, I would consider the options somewhat equally (un)attractive.

&amp;#x200B;

Is one enough, or would you like to go to both? Especially Spurs facing Watford next week, West Ham facing Sheffield and Newcastle both home in the following weeks, then Spurs  fixture against Sheffield at home again, rotation doesn't sound like such a crazy idea? Especially not considering that with both options you can easily avoid top 6 fixtures with the exception of GW18.

&amp;#x200B;

Spurs hard **fixtures** before the end of the year:

GW10 - Liverpool

GW15 - ManU

GW18 - Chelsea

&amp;#x200B;

WHam hard **fixtures** before the end of the year:

GW13 - Spurs

GW14 - Chelsea

GW16 - Arsenal

GW18 - Liverpool

&amp;#x200B;

At the best, going with two back up keepers for a lengthy period is risky. Especially considering the form of both teams defensively (in number of CS and xCS). Just to remind, this is investment worth 8.8 in the GKs, meaning that the alternative would be getting 4.8 keeper instead. Practically speaking this leaves out Patricio, Guaita, Schmeichel, Leno etc., hence the only potential alternatives would be 4.5-4.6 bargains such as Henderson, Ryan, Pope or Heaton. For those wildcarding during the IB, the 4.4+4.4 option could look attractive.",self.FantasyPL,,1570554403.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dexez9/gazzaniga_roberto_44_gk_pair_for_the_rest_of_2019/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dexez9/gazzaniga_roberto_44_gk_pair_for_the_rest_of_2019/,57,24,24,"['Get one of Ryan/Pope and stick with either.', ""I'm happy with Pope and the spiritual coverage he gives my side.

382,r/FantasyPL,MrPottiez,How about Wesley as a Pukki replacement,"Villa have a couple of rough fixtures after the deadline with City and Liverpool being 2 of the next 3 and it might seem like a kneejerk after Villa scored 5 against norwich, but hear me out. 

With an xG of 4.59 he is #5 in the EPL, while even being #1 over the last 3 GWs. He costs £6M, is nailed and seems to be on penalties (although he missed one this week). 

Brigthon seems like an okay fixture and after liverpool and City (whose defence also seems, to say it nicely, rocky) they face wolves, newcastle and Man United. Does not seem too bad imo.

389,r/FantasyPL,Coato,Man City Asset Discussion,"I read the r/MCFC page a little for background too.

I currently have KDB, Otamendi and Sterling and am wondering if any of the three are worth dealing with. This is my first year of FPL so I am a bit naive but here are the issues I see and questions I have:

&amp;#x200B;

**Big Question 1: Can you finish in the top 200k without Man City assets?**

This doesn't need explanation. It seems like one big headache. Could it be avoided all together assuming you demonstrate the same amount of skill picking non-MCFC players as MCFC? (Meaning, of course it can be avoided if you are insanely good, what if you have normal skills.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Big Question 2: How well-priced were Man City assets at beginning of season? Have they moved to a place where they are ""fair""?**

Price seems to be a combination of ability, role, and team strength (and in some cases injury history is baked in). There are many prospects like Salah, where it seemed that the FPL population was comfortable with all three. Price Discovery (stock term) is the changes in value as questions are answered-murky roles or questions about team strength for instance. The most volatile possibilities are where all three are unclear (Pukki, Abraham, Mount). Movements with established players happen as one of the three might be resolved (Examples: everyone seemed to know Lei's ability and Maddison's role but there were questions around whether his ability was a one-year flash or sustainable, TAA is not sharing time with Gomez but most of his value rise is because everyone knew he was good but thought he might alternate more, Spurs being a worse team dragging down Kane's potential to score even though he has shown the same ability and hasn't lost time, etc.)

**Big Question 3: If you think about each player's upside price (the price at which you would say, this is too high, I am going to cash out) and downside price (the price at which you would buy them, no matter how bad their season was looking) how many are closer to the top than the bottom?** 

Obviously if a player gets injured than everyone's price would fluctuate, but given the past 8 games of team ability and role stretching out in a reasonable fashion-nobody becomes dramatically different, team continues to be inconsistent, roles are basically unknowable week to week except for Ederson and KDB when healthy). I don't know much but only KDB and Mahrez seemed to have more down than up factored into their initial pricing. I like Peter Blake's .7 points per week per million as a metric. How many Man City players are over-priced given their knowns?

**Big Question 4: Are all minutes equal? Do the type of minutes a Man City player gets change their value?**

It seems like only KDB and Sterling get scheduled ""games off"" of the sure starters. Aguerro seems to have been a late sub in two of the 4 games in which Jesus was healthy. Mahrez, Silvas, Walker, Mendy, etc have all been subbed off or on. This clearly changes a defender's value since non-started clean sheets or halftime subs are valueless. Does it change the value of a front player too? This seems to affect Man City players far more than other teams whose backups don't have FPL value.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for any answers/discussion. I feel like my team will be a lot better if I could just get my head around the Man City players on it.",self.FantasyPL,Discussion,1570509568.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/depe5g/man_city_asset_discussion/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/depe5g/man_city_asset_discussion/,65,46,46,"['Here’s the way I look at the situation. \n\nEvery single top team will have tough spells during the season as will every single top player it’s just how football is. At the moment clearly City are on a bit of poor form. But there is absolutely zero doubt they are either the best or second best team in the league so it’s very easy for them to snap out of this poor form and go rip off a crazy win streak as they did at the back end of the season to win the title. So I guess my first point is I don’t think this form will continue\n\nSecondly, let’s evaluate the options people own. KDB is sensational and whenever he’s started City have looked phenomenal if he’s fit he’s must own afaic. As for the 2 premiums. Let’s talk Sterling and Aguero. Aguero is the top scorer not named KDB, will get the bulk of the starts and is capable of a hat trick on any given week. If you own him u hold him. As for Sterling, he’s still on pace for 220+ by the end of the season which is very solid but he has been underperforming his xG ever since his hatty against West Ham. From watching City games I think he’s been quite unlucky and is still capable of turning his form around, not only that but he was very unfortunate to get rested before the Watford blood bath. Assuming everybody owns 1 of Salah and Mane there’s only reasonably room for 1 more premium and I believe Sterling and Aguero remain the best choices. Aubameyang is definitely in the discussion but I trust City’s consistency over Arsenal, I have considered going from Sterling to Aguero but I feel like they will end the season on very similar scores and it’s a sideways move which will take 2 transfers.\n\nMoving onto the back line. Clearly City are not what they were with Laporte. Pep employs a high line and they’ve become far more susceptible to the counter in Laporte’s absence. However, Otamendi only costs 5.4 (if you brought him in after Laportes injury) and City are still more solid than any of the top 6 sides apart from Liverpool. Not only that but Otamendi provides a goal scoring threat on set pieces and City’s next 3 fixtures look nice. \n\nSo to me this whole panic about City is an overreaction I will be holding onto all 3 assets and I wouldn’t be surprised if they demolished the next 3 teams they play.', ""City are so up and down I can't tell you whether they will beat Palace 4-0 with Sterling and Aguero getting 2 goals each or if they will draw 1-1  and you end up getting 4 points from 2 players worth 25 mil.\n\nI only have KDB and I think I'm gonna stick with him as my single City asset for now."", 'Put this into perspective sterling is sitting at 48 points. 20 of those points came in the first game week. 28 points over 7 weeks in an easy run of fixtures for a 12m mid. On top of this you never know when he will get rested. Does he have good underlying stats, yes but will that convert to points? So far it hasn’t', 'Defensively awful without Laporte. If Cutrone could finish it would have been 5 - 0.', ""I think it's time to drop City defensive assets, they've been fairly lucky not to concede in some games this season even before Laporte got injured. \n\nKdB is essential, no two ways about it, so he has to stay.\n\nI believe one of sterling and aguero is still essential, both will get similar points over the course of the season but aguero is more consistent imo while sterling has a higher ceiling but is more streaky. I'm going with aguero mainly because he's on pens and I think he's practically guaranteed starts every game."", 'How are we feeling about Dilva? He’s the cheapest option out of the other offensive midfielders, seems to play on the same depth as KDB, but obviously might be rotated.', ""I'm suprised that David Silva doesn't seem to appear anywhere in conversations regd Man City. He's gotten consistent gametime and minutes and a pretty good points tally. And he's pretty cheaply priced at 7.6"", 'You all realise KDB and Augero are top 2 point scorers without playing all games and sterling is top 10 lol.', 'I think any 2 man combination of Sterling, KDB and Kun will get you solid points all season.']"

I think I need my gut checked and replaced.', ""&gt;if you don't have the ability to make these quick decisions based on intuition mostly confidently then you will miss out on so many opportunities because you see dangers that aren't actually real. confidence a feeling of self assurance arising from one's appreciation of one's own abilities or qualities. I am magnus carlsen I am from Norway I'm a chess grandmaster of 27 years old I am the number one ranked chess player in the world and the current world champion. chess is a very difficult game it's very hard often to know whether you're making the right decision or the right evaluation but still it's important to have confidence often in chess when you calculate a line sometimes you miss something but it turns out later down the road that that was not that was not important that your intuition told you to make a quick confident decision was actually right after all. I think the first time I started to be really confident in chess was when I was 17 years old before that I often had too much respect for my more esteemed colleagues. my game against Kasparov in 2004 when I was 13 is a prime example of my lack of confidence that at that time.  I spent way way too much time calculating in variations that weren't actually dangerous naturally he was a much much stronger player than I was back then there was no doubt about that but in that particular game if I had actually believed very seriously that I could beat Kasparov then I probably would have managed but when I was 16 17 years old I gotten to the level where there was no higher level I was so I was playing against the best players in the world and I discovered very quickly that in order to not just draw them but to beat them you have to have the believe that you know you you can compete with anybody and that was the first time I really found that and within a few years I was completely convinced rightly or not that I was the man that I was the best it's often very difficult when you lose for me. I just need to somehow be able to strike back I need to get a win right after a loss or a disappointing result because if these bad results linger then it's just going to take a lot of time to to get your confidence again. I would say that I've  never been very good at losing. I hate losing and I don't handle it very well and I always cope with it by thinking that yeah I should be better at not losing instead of being better at  handling. So my basic conclusion would be that you have to trust yourself you have to trust your instincts and your experience accumulated over many years if you're if you're not able to do that you're you're not going to go very far it's better to trust your gut and be burned sometimes than to always second-guess yourself."", 'If only I can get myself to do this: ""it is better to trust your gut and get burnt sometimes than to always second guess yourself""', 'I learn’t quickly this being my first season doing fpl to trust my intuition more than the general opinion here which switches frequently and downvotes other valid options.', ""This is the worst advice lol basically just survivorship bias - trust your intuition works if you're a chess grandmaster whose intuition happens to be correct a lot of the time, not so much if you're a fucking idiot like the rest of us."", 'Intuition in hindsight is always right', ""Beware.

They seem to have found good form and have been scoring goals too. CHO looks to be nailed going forward and mount is playing in the hole behind Tammy.

Do you think CHO will be a better pick for the upcoming weeks compared to Mason Mount? CHO is cheaper too, could utilize funds elsewhere.",self.FantasyPL,Discussion,1570486291.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dejyuc/callum_hudson_odoi_vs_mason_mount/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dejyuc/callum_hudson_odoi_vs_mason_mount/,45,44,44,"['Mason mount seems to be nailed on this season and CHO might be subject to rotation risk. I think mount is the better choice because of this, but CHO will be in a better position to score at winger when he plays.', 'CHO isnt nailed as of yet, one start does not mean nailed. Mount is proven and nailed now, unless injured he will play until maybe RLC comes back, even then i think lampard puts Mount out wide instead of as a CAM. CHO has impressed with 3 assists in 3. Currently im taking Mount over CHO if you had to choose one and not doubling up', 'I believe CHO is the better asset once he becomes a first team regular and am considering bringing him over mount as i see how the international break plays out with their performances. Pedro is likely 3rd/4th choice with pulisic then willian and cho being 1st and 2nd. With 4 fit wingers you won’t see mount being played out wide anymore and the timeline for RLC return seems to be back in training (light training i think) in November and imo once fit will take mounts spot and likely play more minutes if they will both be deployed as attacking mids. CHO vs southampton got in better attacking positions and when emerson returns will have an overlapping fullback to link up with to further improve his play and at 5.9 thats great value + 1g and 3 assists in his last 4 games with many missed opportunities.', 'as a mount owner and chelsea fan, i personally think CHO might be a better option, not only cheaper but usually higher up the pitch. dont think either is at a risk of rotation, unless theres an injury issue or players being too charged of minutes, but that goes for both, maybe CHO slightly higher risk cuz he just came back from a long injury, but should be nailed.', 'Mount looks the more safe pick and matured player as well so i’d go with tammy and him before considering Odoi', 'To early to say for CHO. Mount is confirmed starter. Give it a few weeks to see about CHO.', 'Oof. Pretty 50/50. Probably Mount right now, but my only worry is that whenever Frank changes to a 4-3-3, Mount is the player who will get shifted back into the midfield 3 while CHO stays in the front 3. I think we saw that today for periods of the Soton game but Mount was still very effective overall. I would expect them both to be nailed starters in the near future. CHO is obviously a bit less certain than Mount but I wouldn’t be too worried. I honestly think getting both wouldn’t be unwise as they’re equally great options. \n\nMount is the better player for sure right now but you can’t argue with CHO’s numbers and CHO has a lot of room to improve considering he’s just come back from injury', ""Stick with Mount. CHO is a very talented young player, but he is quite predictable in 1 on 1s. He opens his body up and gives the goalkeeper way too long to see where he will shoot. He's had several attempts on goal for Chelsea in the last couple of games, and yes he has produced, but he doesn't quite have the finishing touch that Mount has. I'll keep watching him play, but for now he stays on my watchlist while Mount and Abraham stay in my Starting XI."", 'I have CHO (ever since hecame back), Mount and Tammy. Sue me']"

A quick reminder of the rules for this league:

- You are allowed infinite transfers every week, only the gameweek score is counted and hits are ignored.

- Anything goes! Chips are allowed.

**Bang average** would be the description of Gameweek 8 as most teams scored around the global average of **36** and the FPL Scout scoring [exactly the average](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/180883/event/8) in a week that proved tough for most managers to predict. Common captains **Sterling, Aguero, Aubameyang, Pukki, Son, Salah** and **Kane** *all* blanked, surprisingly not a single manager capped the in-form **Tammy Abraham**.

Top scorer of the week was **No Loyalties Fc** who scored an astonishing [**71**](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/5870439/event/8) points with giant killer **Adama Traoré** getting the armband for 32 points! What is even more incredible is that No Loyalties Fc didn't even make a transfer this week despite having actively played up until now (they have made 48 transfers this season), they even missed out on Wesley's 14-point haul sitting on the bench!

Perhaps it's time to look at our strategy each week and consider veering away from the obvious options with our weekly wildcards when teams like this are getting so many points and others like [**Yötön yö**](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/2815848/event/8) are getting just **17!**

415,r/FantasyPL,adishriLFC,A good read. Callum Hudson-Odoi is rewarding Frank Lampard's faith at Chelsea. Averaging goal/assist every 55 mins. But it's his all-round game which is making lampard to chose him over pulisic.,,skysports.com,News,1570461308.0,,{},https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/11829675/callum-hudson-odoi-is-rewarding-frank-lampards-faith-at-chelsea,/r/FantasyPL/comments/deg1l4/a_good_read_callum_hudsonodoi_is_rewarding_frank/,72,542,542,"['A goal or assist every 55 minutes\n\nHe’s played 2 games in the Premier League this season, that is not a good sample size to start throwing those kinds of stats around.', 'Some of the points from this article-\n\nCallum Hudson-Odoi did not touch the ball in the build-up to Chelsea\'s third goal against Southampton. The statistics will show no involvement of any kind on his part. But the chance, converted by N\'Golo Kante with the help of a deflection, would not have arisen without him.\n\nFirst, there was the decoy run to drag Southampton right-back Jan Valery out of position and leave the overlapping Marcos Alonso in space to pick up Jorginho\'s pass. Then, having accelerated forward to rejoin the attack, there was the dummy which allowed the Spaniard\'s cut-back to roll through his legs to Kante, who was better positioned to take advantage.\n\nThat passage of play, which came just as Southampton were threatening an equaliser, showed selflessness and intelligence to match the explosive pace and dribbling ability that have marked him out as such a special talent. Hudson-Odoi is still only 18. This was his first Premier League start of the season. But he keeps finding new ways to impress.\n\nChelsea\'s opening goal, for which he\xa0did\xa0register an assist, was another example. There seemed to be little on when he collected the ball inside his own half following a Southampton attack, but some 40 yards further forward, he spotted Tammy Abraham running beyond his man and picked him out with a raking pass which landed directly at his feet.\n\nIt is less than a year ago that, frustrated by a lack of opportunity under Maurizio Sarri and amid interest from Bayern Munich, Hudson-Odoi handed in a transfer request. Now, though, he is tied to a long-term contract at the club and keeping the £58m Christian Pulisic out of the team.\n\nHudson-Odoi\'s repertoire is widening by the week and there were plenty of examples of the things he does best against Southampton too.\n\nLampard was critical of his reluctance to run in behind during Chelsea\'s demolition of Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup last month, but it was clear that he has heeded those comments from as early as the 11th minute at St Mary\'s, when he latched onto a Cesar Azpilicueta through-ball and teed up Abraham for Chelsea\'s first chance of the afternoon.\n\n""That\'s where I want him,"" said Lampard in his press conference afterwards. The Chelsea manager praised his work-rate out of possession, adding: ""Staying tight to the midfield and then releasing themselves against the full-backs, it\'s all the things I want from the wingers.""', ""Took a punt on him for this GW and it's already paying off. I'm hoping he nails a spot on the left (or right) and at £5.9m, he'll be a snip."", 'If he nails the left side, only gets better for Mount at the centre. Possibly a 352, downgrade a 3rd striker to accommodate CHO.', ""And because he's a far superior player than Pulisic"", 'He looked okay, way too early to start spouting stats for him, Kantes goal was lucky really. \nHe kept trying to cut in and take chances but didn’t take these well/Soton defended well against him.\n\nMay be worth a punt but Mount and Tammy look like better Chelsea picks imo', 'He looks wasetful in front of goal. Missed 2 (maybe even 3?) one on ones against us in the League Cup the other week and missed a good chance at the weekend.', ""I mean, Bayern weren't trying to give Chelsea £40m for no reason."", 'When Pulisic came on he played well']"

1. Tom Dobson and *Holloway Highway* who is our **worst team of the week** with 21 points. Interesting fact: he only avoided the drop last week by one place.
2. Aikins Sewor with *Kins FC*. That -12 hit taking no prisoners once again!
3. Savio D'Cruz with *Bhandup Boys*
4. Oladipo Aregbes ola Ameen with *I AM IRON MAN F.C.* I guess you are not inevitable after all.
5. Dr. Evil with *WanaBissaka Your Mum*. No you don't. Off you go!
6. Dan Hardcastle with *Club Foot*. Winner of the **highest ranked player** (previously number 7) **to drop award!** That's a magnificent fall from grace :D
7. Abhinav Shankar with *Kids@TielemansSquare* (what does this mean? Who knows)
8. Jake Bevan with *Say Neymar*
9. Prateek Jaya Prakash with *Chuckle Brothers FC*
10. And finally, Lushalin Moodley with \[prepares copy and paste\] *乇乂ㄒ尺卂　ㄒ卄丨匚匚匚匚匚匚匚匚匚匚匚*

Bad luck everyone between 8. - 10., you only missed the drop by one point.

Very interesting fact: only two players in the bottom ten took hits this week.

**Set and forget league**

I can barely bring myself to type this, but **my own team**, the mighty *Forlán's Forgotten*, took an almighty fall from grace. Sitting pretty in fourth place, they are now out of the competition with a frankly Spurs-esque **25 points**. The **only** player who didn't blank for me was Matty Ryan (no surprise, legend).

428,r/FantasyPL,RealJesseLingard,Would triple defence fodder be viable?,"Most premium defenders are no longer worth the premium you pay for them. Just look at fucking John Lundstram, one of the highest point scorers and I got him in for an outstanding 4.0. You put all your faith in him, when he returns - it’s excellent, when he doesn’t - who cares he’s 4 MILLION.

When VVD blanks - you cry, when he returns at the same rate as Lundstram - .....you wonder why you own him. Fear of missing out? Nailed on LIV CB? Aerial Threat? He still has less points than the legend himself Lundstram.


Now I won’t reveal my team and it’ll be labelled as a sneaky RMT, but it consists of a Liverpool fullback, a city center back and three, sub 4.2 defenders. This allows me to have a strong midfield 5 with an excellent fodder and a more than respectable front 3. Is anyone else going for this approach or is it simply too risky? Even if it IS too risky, isn’t this how you win the game?

Quite the opposite in fact he's scoring very well and currently has more points per game than last season. Now I get that he's not been as good as he has been form wise but take a second to think about what that actually means. Either he or Liverpool have genuinely gotten worse and he will continue to look like he's fallen off a bit (spoiler it's not this one), or it's a period of less good form that will end. You'd be forgiven for worrying about Salah's future output if he was unproven or had a history of inconsistency but that's the opposite of being the case. And anyway despite the poor form he's scored well. \n\nSo assuming you take the view that he's not fallen off a cliff and is still more or less the same player we know and love, the only reason you'd take him out is to bring someone else in until he comes back to his super high scoring form then get him back in. But what's the point of that if he's scoring nearly seven points a game even in bad form? You'll lose more points faffing around getting him in and out than you'll gain.\n\nEdit: also despite the 'poor form' his xG is signify higher than Mané's with 5.06 (second in the league) to 3.60"", 'Well then all those Creationists in Kansas were right after all consarn it', 'Ok but let’s say next game salah scores a hatrick and mane does nothing.

430,r/FantasyPL,Throwaymn,Are Sterling and Salah worth it?,"Sterling has 14 in his last 5, and Salah has 24. Neither of these are good returns at their prices. However, I feel that there isn't much place better to put your money. Auba and KDB seem to be the only premiums really worth it at the moment. Most of the value this season has lied in mid priced players - Abraham, Mount, Pukki, Haller, Wilson etc. In defence only TAA and Otamendi(?) really look to be decent value at above 5m. As such, although Sterling and Salah may not be very worth their prices, I don't think it's worth it to get rid of both of them. Maybe dump one to get Auba in if you don't already, but removing both just leaves you with too much money and nothing to spend it on. Better spend the money for marginally better returns than leave money ITB. Personally I'll be keeping both for now. Salah always seems to reemerge and start scoring again after a while, and Sterling most likely will bring decent returns once KDB is back.",self.FantasyPL,,1570404773.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/de4qwr/are_sterling_and_salah_worth_it/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/de4qwr/are_sterling_and_salah_worth_it/,74,41,41,"[""Seems nobody is worth anything tbh.

I wouldn\'t bet on MCI repeating the same lengthy slump yet again. \n\nFor me, Sterling stays and continues to carry the captain armband. For Salah, there are cheaper options in Mane and Firmino.

Heck I'm not even talking about those with Auba who might run riot against a Bournemouth defence which have conceded an average of 3.3 goals against top 6 oppositions since 18/19.


I'm in total shambles for not having any Man City players now. Could have swapped De Bruyne for Mahrez/Bilva/Silva for damage control. Pretty sure they would have at least 1 return even if they were to come in from the bench (Pep either starts em or plays them as a supersub). 


Seems like spurs, pukki, Salah, double pool defence has brought down the average so far. Wrong premium captaincy choice would also take a serious toll on your ML/overall rankings this week since it would be difficult to compensate for points from your other areas (more blanks among essentials this week).

Any team in my sample of top 500k which hasn't made a transfer in last 3 weeks gets excluded.

Determination of who is a veteran manager at:  https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/cqn30q/refining_the_veteran_analysis_aka_what_is_the/ 

The  2519  veterans made  2700 transfers this GW.  42 ( 1.7 %) played their wild card.
( 56.7 % have now already played WC)

For the picks comparison, I have filtered out the low ownership (but high ratio &gt; 1.2) players (threshold is 2%). If you don't see a player below then it will be because there is not enough ownership or the ratio is not big enough.

492,r/FantasyPL,ThePoliticalGuy,This is why I have sold De Bruyne and why you should too.,"Tldr; PEP Wont Start Him

Even after he recovers from his injury Pep will know not to play him. According tothe rumours/ speculation flying around, I very much doubt he will even start a game in the international break and once he returns Pep won't start him for a couple more game weeks. I am definitely sure Pep remembers what happened last season when he rushed him back to early for the champions league causing him to suffer a long term injury and diminishing their overall champions league success. So, Pep wont start Kevin for a few more weeks whilst he is looking more injury prone then ever, that alone would probably cause a short on his price and cause it too plummet although the implications have far not been reached this game week. However, after the international break is over and he doesn't start GM9. His price will plummet.

So, it is important to start selling him now for 10.00 and possibly avoiding the depreciation in his price and invest in Madison who will probably start this week. Once invested in Madison for 2-3 Game weeks his price will increase to around 7-9.0 then sell him to get money back to buy DE Bruyne at his cheaper price, once he has recovered from his injury and is starting games.",self.FantasyPL,,1570288666.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/ddjyhq/this_is_why_i_have_sold_de_bruyne_and_why_you/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/ddjyhq/this_is_why_i_have_sold_de_bruyne_and_why_you/,71,0,0,"['Firstly as he is flagged his price will drop slower (as we have already seen he was rated -105 last night and didn’t fall). so I think this makes selling him to avoid loosing value a false economy also as most have owned since 9.5 they can take a .1 drop with no effect. \n\nSpeculation on when he will return is a tough one for a normal manager let alone pep. \n\nYou make a valid point about last season when pep rushes him back and just made matters worse. What your forgetting this is a completely different injury, last year it was a serious long term injury this is small niggle and resting him this weekend and over the IB is most likely a precaution on its own in order to preserve his fitness. You have also ignored how city fell apart with out him against Norwich, this will be fresh in peps mind. \n\nWe could very well see him return after this game week as he has a further 14 day period to recover. \n\nFor me this could very well end up be a one week punt and they are rarely worth it.\n\nI think you have to ask are the the points you can make over his bench option in your team worth more than up to .3 TV?\n\nYou’re relying on not getting an injury over the IB to deal with in order to get him straight back in which is worth remembering.\n\nI think if you have a decent bench player (Cantwell home against Villa or Lundstram away to Watford) then It’s probably best to hold and wait further news especially if you had him since 9.5 as you can take a .1 drop with out loosing anything.', 'Or he returns after the international bracket and double digit returns, it’s all just guess work unless we get a firm update on the extent of his injury', ""Fwiw, I have sold KdB, but it's a gamble and let's not dress it up otherwise.

505,r/FantasyPL,ASongOfLifeAndLiars,The case for dropping KDB this week...,"Hear me out. I think if you currently have 2 FT, enough money in the bank, and no injuries, I think you should take KDB out for another midfield started this week. AKA KDB -&gt; Son.

Cons: 

You'd make two extra transfers when you don't need to by taking him out and bringing him back in next week. 

Your replacement blanks, and your player off the bench who you would've played instead of KDB gets more points.

Pros:

If the injury is more serious than it looks and he's out for a long time, you're already ahead of everybody and you've made a transfer that boosts your team value.

If you bring in Son, who rises tonight, he could double rise over the break, and therefore you'll have enough money to easily bring back KDB whose price is set to fall.

A player like Son or Mahrez easily outscores your Cantwell or Rico who would've played as a back up.

So...

In the poll above vote for the player you want to captain. The winner will be our captain and the runner-up will be our vice captain.

**[BENCH POLL](https://www.strawpoll.me/18739231)**

Vote for the 2 outfield players you want to have on the bench. The player with the most votes will be placed second last on the bench and we will follow this process until the bench is complete. Since KDB is ruled out for this gameweek, he automatically grabs the third spot on our bench.

526,r/FantasyPL,bendog1616,Expected results this weekend based off xG &amp; xGA so far.,"So just to quickly try and explain the formula...

Home team goals: Average of Home teams xG &amp;amp;amp; Away teams xGA

Away team goals: Average of Home teams xGA &amp;amp;amp; Away teams xG

For example using the City - Wolves game as an example...

City ave xG at home: 4.05. Wolves ave xGA away: 1.01. Average between the 2 - 2.53. This figure is City’s xG this weekend.

City xGA at home: 0.43. Wolves xG away: 1.52. Average between the 2 - 0.98.

So the xResult for that match this weekend is Man City 2.53 - 0.98 Wolves.

Results for all the matches (difference in brackets):

Man City 2.53 - 0.98 Wolves (1.54)

Liverpool 1.82 - 0.71 Leicester (1.11)

Brighton 1.92 - 1.13 Spurs (0.79)

Newcastle 0.69 - 1.30 Man Utd (0.61)

Norwich 1.91 - 1.31 Aston Villa (0.60)

Arsenal 1.95 - 1.43 Bournemouth (0.52)

Watford 1.79 - 1.41 Sheff Utd (0.38)

West Ham 1.51 - 1.19 Crystal Palace (0.32)

Southampton 1.68 - 1.80 Chelsea (0.12)

Burnley 1.18 - Everton 1.18 (0.00)

Obviously things need to be taken into account - West Ham for example were home to City gw1 where they had an xGA of 3.18. If you take this match out of the equation then the expected score would be West Ham 1.51 - 0.86 C. Palace (instead of 1.51 - 1.19).",self.FantasyPL,,1570218392.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dd68sm/expected_results_this_weekend_based_off_xg_xga_so/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dd68sm/expected_results_this_weekend_based_off_xg_xga_so/,6,7,7,"['1. xG has no predictive value in short term, only long term.\n\n2.

I was hoping to get it written up yesterday, but it takes about 7-9 hours to run and I needed to experiment with a new improvement so had to run it a few times. I'm still not satisfied with the output, so I don't want to write a proper post about it on which some people might actually base their decisions. I'm also super busy today so can't rerun and write later.  This does mean, though, that next gameweek the model will be improved and more informative, and I should be able to run it overnight as soon as the data is available, and get a post up in good time.

**Take the following with a pinch of salt:**

From what output I do have, it looks like **Agüero** is the most logical pick again. Also, **Aubameyang** is now clearly breaking into the top 5-10, **Kane** is climbing, and **Salah**, **Mané**, **Sterling**, and **De Bruyne** are all still in the top bunch. **Vardy** would be up there but isn't because he is playing Liverpool. Players like **Pukki** are still highly dependent on how informative the prior is.

He's in good form. In FPL terms he's been lacking explosivity, though, and I think part of the reason for that is that Arsenal haven't been all that great so far (apart from in specific moments). I think Bournemouth will score and will cause them a fair bit of trouble. I'd say the odds of a Sterling haul are shorter than those of an Auba haul.

539,r/FantasyPL,buangjauh2,"To drop or keep Salah, here's why","Why drop Salah:

3/4 upcoming tricky fixtures.

Poor stats vs top6. I don't have the stats rn, but I remember someone pulled Salah's data from last season, and he didn't score many points vs top 6.

His 12.5 price tag hasn't moved so far. Dropping him for 4 GW won't lose us money when switching him back later. We can even pick up Mane for the extra money.


Why keep Salah:

MU &amp; Spurs are shite at the moment.

41% ownership right now. Almost everyone in my ML has him. Dropping him will be a high risk high reward move.

It seems like everyone on the RMT threads has a variant of the same team, consistently, every week. You can easily afford the most expensive players. You shouldn’t be able to afford 3 out of the 4 most expensive midfielders in one team. You shouldn’t be able to have Salah, KDB, Sterling and Auba/Kane/Aguero. 

Imagine the effect it would have if you were given even 10m less in the bank. Players would be scanning for value in the bottom half of the table more and everyone’s teams would be much more diverse and interesting.

It's already pretty interesting, there are a LOT of options for different players now, it's not as inflexible as it was at the start of the season. \n\nAnd there's no guarantee that the value scanning will not result in most people having the same team anyways, which causes us to come back to the original problem. Not to mention casuals would be absolutely destroyed like this because they're not as hard core as us. Plus, in the end, for me I enjoy way more hoping Sterling grabs a hat trick than watching a midtable matches between Burnley and Brighton with Trossard and Wood, so it comes down to enjoyment for me and many others."", ""When you are in an echo chamber like Reddit or Twitter, doesn't matter what changes you make to the game, there will always be a consensus that certain players will be best in slot for the team (a.k.a. template team). It is what it is."", 'But then other players would just become template. You’ll never really be able to move away from mass selected players, the price on them doesnt matter. Look at Soy, Lundstram, Mount etc. Im sure you have mini leagues that have serious players and casual players, and Im going to assume all the serious players are at the top with fairy similar teams. If you reduce the cap the players will change but teams will stay similar', 'Having less budget would just mean everyone would have lundstram, cantwell, mcginn, mount, Abraham, pukki, tomori + Salah/Sterling and KDB. \n\nWe’d still find a way to develop a template lol the budget isn’t the problem.', 'I agree with the principal of addressing the so called ""template"" team, but I\'m not sure that reducing the bank/increasing prices is the way to do it.\n\nCurrently, based off the top 15 owned players, you can argue that Pukki, Abraham, Mount, Lundstram and Cantwell are just as ""template"" as the likes of Salah, KDB, Sterling etc, and even with a smaller bank would almost certainly remain so. \n\nReducing the bank would be more likely to produce diversity in the first few weeks, when the seasons cheap gems haven\'t revealed themselves yet, but as is true with the current system a template will be arrived upon in due course.', 'I actually enjoy the game, as it is. Making too many changes may make it less interesting. On the flip, couple of suggestions;\n\nTo make it more interesting, may be lower threshholds for price changes, allowing someone like a pukki or abraham to reach 8m+ faster, so making people a bit more open to changes. \n\nAnother change may be to allow people 2 points for not taking up any free transfers, which would provide people with incentive to stick to their players']"

Auba's next 5: BOU, shu, CRY, WOL, lei

Considering MCI's next 4 fixtures are green, therefore either Sterling or KDB would be the leading captain picks for the next 3 gameweeks, and the only GW where Salah could hurt you is if most people captain him against Aston Villa, could dropping him be a viable option?

On the other hand, Auba has 5 green fixtures. With his form and rests from the Europa League, he could be a captaincy option for the next 5 weeks.

So, would a Salah + Greenwood swap to Auba + cheap mid ultimately yield you more points, considering you'd likely only captain Salah in GW11 (one of the next 5 weeks)? Or could dropping Salah (and more importantly dropping a liverpool attacker) hurt you because despite relying on a consistent striker (Auba), you're also relying on an inconsistent Arsenal?

54 points was our total in GW7. We scored just above the average (51) and with that came another rise in OR. Mind you, it was only a small rise, up 142k places to 1,728,976, but at least we've stopped the bleeding.

King (12), KDB (9), VVD (8), Sterling (7) and new recruit Mount (6) bring home the points. Pepulant fraud makes our other transfer, Zinchenko to Otamendi, look a bit mundane, but at least no hits were taken for it. And although captain Salah did blank, we didn't take too much of a punishment in a week where captain returns were mediocre.

#How to Play

You post your predictions for each fixture in the format specified (e.g. `Manchester United v Crystal Palace (2-1)`) and you are awarded points as per the following:

A correct result (e.g. 1-0) = 1 point

A correct score (e.g. 2-1) = 3 points

You will be awarded either 0, 1 or 3 points (with a maximum score of 3 points) per fixture.

So in the hypothetical fixture above, if the match ended 2-1 and you had predicted 3-2 to United, you would be awarded 1 point. 

If you predicted 2-1 to United, you would be awarded the full 3 points.

If you predicted a draw or a Palace win, you would score 0 points.

[**You can see a more detailed explanation of the rules here.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/cmvubh/predictions_league_gw1_thread/)


#GW8 Fixtures and Format

* Brighton v Spurs (H-A)
* Burnley v Everton (H-A)
* Liverpool v Leicester (H-A)
* Norwich v Aston Villa (H-A)
* Watford v Sheffield Utd (H-A)
* West Ham v Crystal Palace (H-A)
* Arsenal v Bournemouth (H-A)
* Man City v Wolves (H-A)
* Southampton v Chelsea (H-A)
* Newcastle v Man Utd (H-A)


Each prediction must be in the following format:

* `Home Team v Away Team (2-1)`

This is because /u/hi-i-am-new-here
's Excel macro expects predictions in this format and ignores everything else. 

The most important parts of each prediction are the hyphen (`-`) and the brackets (`()`). 

Please do not use colons (`:`) or other brackets because the macro is not looking for these.

The order is the next most important thing because e.g. if you post your Burnley v Southampton prediction before the Bournemouth v Sheffield Utd fixture, then the macro will take your Burnley v Southampton prediction as your Bournemouth v Sheffield Utd prediction.  

In previous seasons, predictions not fitting this format and order have been manually corrected but this will only be the case this season in very rare exceptions. You are responsible for your own predictions.

Or Soyuncu who is the same, against Liverpool who has scored at least 3 in every home game? There aren’t a lot of clear choices this week for defenders. Soton, despite scoring 3 at home in 3 games, one keeper blunder, and a penalty among them, is probably the side I’ll gamble on. Feel free to tell me who to add this week instead.\n\nEdit 2: earn/deserve is the wrong word. But Soton’s three home goals this year don’t speak volumes to them being a team that are prolific at home.

There are loads of great content creators out there. We all know there’s no lacking of banter in the FPL universe! We’ve all got our favourites: Podcasts, Articles, Shitposting Twitter Accounts, Broken Bots, there’s something for everyone. But after nearly 2 years since joining this awesome community, I realised that I don’t really *know* much about the people behind the twitter accounts, apart from how good they are at making Fantasy content!


**FPL and Chill** - So I’ve decided to create a brand new show! It’s called FPL and Chill - getting intimate with the managers *behind* the account. We’ll be learning about their hopes, dreams, and secrets to their FPL success, all over a few drinks of course. The show is live streamed here - www.twitch.tv/fpldave at 9pm BST every Thursday. (Yes that means tonight!)


**Guest Tonight** - My very first guest is the man behind TWAT, FFMag and the Fantasy Weekly podcasts, u/tongueinloftuscheek! He’s the Handsomest Smooth-talkingest, Wittiest FPL manager I’ve had the pleasure to talk to and I’m super excited to get to know him more. I’m sure FPL will come up at some point too!


**VIEWER RMTs** - I also wanted to do some RMTs with my guest for you guys, so if you’re looking for a RMT, post a screenshot in the comments, or send them via twitter here - twitter.com/fpl_dave. You’ve got until this post is 3 hours old! (Please don’t just write your team down as it’s visually disgusting and James deserves better.)

Hopefully we see some of you in the chat!

Cheers guys!

Reasonably happy with the results so far, am averaging 58 points per week with some pretty poor captaincy picks.', ""Mine is literally based entirely on my own personal biases on players and nothing to do with fixtures. I'll not trade in a player if they're against a big team that weekend, but beyond that I'm just about the quality of the player. I'll also just avoid some teams that I think are a bit unpredictable or shit flat out, even if they have a good player."", 'I watch 2-3 games every GW(one of which is always Liverpool). After that,i watch MOTD and MNF(whenever there is one) and check some analysis and highlights. After that,i have a plan with 3-4-5 GWs ahead and i try to follow it whenever i can. My last transfer for example was Maddison out and Yarmolenko in. My plan was never to ditch Maddison but the injury happened and after that is Liverpool so i decided to sell him and get him back after that.\n\nMy transfer picks are based on my understanding of football,the teams form or lack there of and fixture runs. I dont rely on stats. I just base my arguments in them. For example,i said West Ham defence is bad and a guy replied that they have 3 CSs and i replied to that with xGs conceded etc. And i try to get differentials. I love them. I could have went with Mount instead of Yarmolenko but decided against and had my reasons. Bournemouth is a bad defence and Yarmo would face Rico who isnt a good defender. Like,at all.He doesnt have much competition and he is the one midfielder that gets in the box. Anderson and Lanzini are more of a creator than finisher.And of course,he had stupidly low ownership with 1.2%.He ended up with a goal and could had more returns. \n\nThe plan was to sell Sterling after the IB in order to get Vardy but the KDB injury may change that. Maddison will 100% return,though. I expect much from him. Also,need to sell Adrian and get TAA after Liverpool-City. A Leicester defender is also a good shout.', ""I look at stats across the past 5 games to see who is in form/threatening/creative and couple that with looking ahead to the next 5 fixtures.  Then I look at the 5 gameweeks past that and see who has good fixtures and add people to my watchlist.  \n\nIf you plan for just the next gameweek, you'll end up knee jerking constantly, taking hits left and right."", 'I bring in whoever had the most points last game week\n\nEdit: If i already have them then 2nd then 3rd etc', 'At start or at WC, try to fill your squad with rock bottom price but regular starting players (such as the likes of Pope Lundstram Rico Cantwell Guendouzi etc) to create more budget to (1) fit in the undervalued players (e.g. Tomori Soyuncu TTA Mount KDB Martial Abraham etc) and (2) get a few premium players that you will captain, and (3) mid price players depending on fixture ease (e.g. Maddison good from GW9 to 17). Based on the above, trade in trade out premiums and mid price players based on five or six GW horizons. Then you will find yourself having a healthy and high strong squad with the needs of very occasional hits', ""I mull things over by checking stats, form, fixtures and listen to some pods. Constantly check prices so I don't get caught out and ponder over changes for days before finally impulsively bringing in someone fairly arbitrarily. It's my curse""]"

575,r/FantasyPL,fantasyfootaball,GW 8 Preview - Players to watch out for in GW 8,"Tomori:

After conceding 13 goals in 6 games, Chelsea finally registered their 1st clean sheet in the last game against Brighton where they allowed only a single shot on target
The young lad accumulates relatively high BPS which makes him a likely candidate for bagging those precious bonus points

In 7games, Chelsea are 3rd for the least shots conceded from inside the box (38)
Their opponents this week, Saints, have only managed to score 7 goals in 7 games played

With Kante also fit and available again, Chelsea look poised to keep the Saints attack at bay this weekend

McGinn:

The Scottish midfielder was a constant threat against Burnley where he bagged a goal and had another one ruled out for offside.
In the last 2 games he has taken the highest shots (5) from inside the box amongst all MIDs and all 5 of those were on target
This weekend at Norwich he will be facing probably the worst defence in the premier league
Norwich have conceded the highest shots from inside their box (85) and have allowed the second highest shots on target (43

Yarmolenko:

The in-form midfielder has scored 3 in his last 4 games and could have had a brace last game.
He has very good all-round stats in the last 4 games with 6 chances created and 5 shots on target
With an ownership of only about 3%, he can be a great differential to bring at a meagre price
With West Ham at home this weekend, we don’t see Palace keeping another cleansheet

Son:

He was not his usual menacing self in the last game but that was partly due to Spurs being reduced to 10 men early on
Still, he got an assist and was constantly involved in the attacking play
Scored the opener in the mid-week drubbing received from Bayern
Since his return from suspension in GW3, he sits second for both total goal attempts (17) as well as shots on target (8) and is no slouch when it comes to creating for his teammates (13 chances created in 5 games)
Meanwhile his opponents this week, Brighton, have conceded a massive 14 shots on target in last 2 games
We back Son to continue his attacking form as Spurs will be looking to bounce back from the mid-week humiliation suffered at the hands of Bayern

While their attack is certainly very good - particularly from an FPL perspective - their defence so far has actually been very leaky, and it's surprising they've only conceded 9 goals so far (their xGA, for reference, is over 14). This is unlikely to be sustainable, obviously. Even their results - apart from that win over United - haven't been all that impressive, having been dominated statistically in draws to Bournemouth, Brighton, and Villa. Certainly a good team, but nowhere close to the lofty heights this article seems to suggest. \n\n3) While Rodgers' Leicester play very positive football, I'm not sure how that's 'the attacking football that the Foxes fans became so accustomed to under Claudio Ranieri'. Ranieri's Leicester, particularly in the title winning season, were known for defensive solidity and effective counter-attacking play.

591,r/FantasyPL,RealJesseLingard,Triple Chelsea is crazy right.....right?,"As a proud Abraham and Mount owner, the thought of bringing in a THIRD Chelsea player sends shivers down my spine. I don’t think I’ve ever done such a thing. Then I realise that the said Chelsea player is a defensive asset....

Tomori. 


But is it that crazy? I have currently two Liverpool players (top of the league), three city (obligatory) and now maybe three Chelsea players?


Mount and Abraham are great attacking assets, they’re on form, fit, and have 5 lovely green fixtures pop up. Tomori picked up an assist tonight, however he defensively looked poor due to his age and experience. However at 4.6 he is a steal, and at least nailed until one of the senior CBs is back. In comparison to 4.6 Leicester defender, Soyuncu, who is also nailed, ALSO has a good chance of CSs due to his fixtures and is essentially an aerial threat - it’s hard to differentiate. My mind tells me safe with Soy, heart tells me to triple up on Chelsea.

605,r/FantasyPL,Interested_Neutral,Fixture Difficulty with Goals and xG for Home and Away (GW8-GW15),"Now that we've had seven games it's time for me to start the fixture difficulty charts I made all last season. If you've not seen these before, I'll describe my methodology below.

&amp;#x200B;

[Goal Scoring Fixtures GW8-15](https://i.redd.it/gs2szzpw95q31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

[Defending Fixtures GW8-15](https://i.redd.it/uu7ex19ha5q31.png)

How do I make these? I take goals scored/allowed and xG/xGA for each team home and away and generate my own ""Goal Value"" for each team in four different dimensions: Scoring Home, Scoring Away, Defending Home, Defending Away.  I then use those GVs to compare goals scored and allowed across the upcoming fixtures. Since I weight actual goals scored with xG I believe this to be a better representation of what to expect out of ""good"" or ""bad"" fixture runs. Splitting things into four dimensions also lets us see that, maybe, the only time you'd want to field a Palace player is a defender at home.

If you've got any questions, let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Here are the goal values used to calculate the charts.

Thank you so much.', ""Great stuff, I've been waiting all season for this! Thanks!"", 'For folks who are color blind, is it possible to sort these by difficulty ?', ""Aubameyang and Vardy don't look as great here as they do on the fpl fixture difficulty!\n\nMaking me think twice about Salah to Auba"", 'Do you mind sharing how the value is calculated?\n\nDo you ascribe more influence to goals scored than xG or are the used on an equal base?\n\nAlso, do you regulate the values based on opponent values or are the factors skewed? E.g. is it taken into account that NOR might be that bad defensively because they faced MCI, CHE, and liv during their first 7 games, whereas EVE only faced MCI in the first 7.\n\nAnother example would be WHU, who lost 0-5 to MCI in the first home match but since kept two cs against MUN and NOR. They sit at the 5th-worst Home GAV even though a defender would have collected 0+6+6=12 points at home in the three matches. Leicester have the second-best Home GAV, but a defender would only have collected 6+2+2 = 10 points in the same amount of home games.\n\nMaybe CS and xCS should figure in the defensive rating? :)']"

A quick reminder of the rules for this league:

- You are allowed infinite transfers every week, only the gameweek score is counted and hits are ignored.

- Anything goes! Chips are allowed.

___

Gameweek 7 was a fairly uneventful week for most managers, with the league average of **52.8** being just a hair higher than the global average of **51**. Once again two players shared the title of top score of the round; [**14 HITS**](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/725649/event/7) and [**Altaf Wildcard Team**](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/2191153/event/7) both scored **78** for a gameweek rank of ~50k. Leicester assets proved essential in their high scores for this week, many of which were overlooked by other teams in the league!

The wooden spoon for this week goes to [**Cant Puu**](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/1904965/event/7) who becomes the first player to have had both the highest and lowest gameweek scores this season! Starting two Newcastle players against Leicester proved to be a terrible decision as Schar and Hayden both scored negative points, resulting in a round score of just **29!**

This was the first week that the Overall Rank #1 team scored below the average, and that has allowed some teams such as **Caw Caw bitches** to close the gap. John Honchkrow's team is now just **26** points away from the top dog, at **504** points they would be 50th in the world based on the current standings!

I think if he plays he has a good chance of returning.. but dont want to be bringing someone in who doesn't start.. as will probably go back to KDB when he is fit again. My value is through the roof already so bringing him back in at 0.2 extra isn't that much of an issue.

Cute assist.\n\nvs. Watford - decent opening period, then faded badly. Struggled to impose himself at all in the second half.\n\nvs. Aston Villa - threatening opening period, creating a couple of good chances.

617,r/FantasyPL,mrdethato,xG Probability &amp; Ability Quantification,"A number of FPL players look up statistics like xG and xA, when deciding whether to keep or get a new player and most of the times, these are helpful.

My concern is that these statistics reflect the goal probability for an average player. So, where do we draw the line on whether a player should do better that this average? Is it past season's statistics for this player over at least the past 3 seasons? We cannot quantify a player's ability otherwise. Sure, there is the ""eye test"", but that is not admissable for a statistical analysis.

Case Study Aubameyang:
Auba has only twice overperformed his xG over his career in the past 6 seasons, for half a season in 17/18 and that was a +0.83 xG difference, and his 14/15 season with a +0.60 xG difference. He is now at -3.42 with tasteful fixtures coming up. If he continues his form, he will continue scoring and this will be a statistical anomaly if he ends up the first round with a xG difference of -7.00 for example. Or do we expect him to regress in the second round for example with a dry run of 6-7 games?

Case study Abraham:
Abraham for example, is flying high with a -2.55 xG difference, again with good fixtures coming up. That is only his third season and the first in the PL. We cannot rely on past stats, so how do we calculate whether he is rightfully over the average xG or if he is just lucky? 

Case Study Aguero:
Aguero has been pretty consistent in the PL over the past years with him scoring 20-25 goals and a xG difference of a range between -1.00 and -4.00, with the exception of the 16/17 season.

[http://fmlfpl.libsyn.com/ep-161-fireside-chat-with-michael-caley](http://fmlfpl.libsyn.com/ep-161-fireside-chat-with-michael-caley)  \nIn it, he talks about how there is no consistency in terms of individual players ""regressing"" to their xG numbers. Some will always overperform  (i.e. Hazard) and some will always underperform. An entire team, however, does tend to regress toward the numbers that xG/xGA imply.', 'xG measures shot quality. There was a good article yesterday (https://fplreview.com/2019/09/how-accurately-does-xg-data-indicate-player-goalscoring-potential/)  showing that over a 40 game period xG/90 is about 12% different from actual G/90. So some regression to the mean or xG value in this case can be expected. \n\nHowever it is important to balance this with the gamblers fallacy. Just because Auba or Abraham is over performing xG doesn’t mean they are due for a 6 or 7 barren run as you say. \n\nWhat it means is that the rate they are scoring goals is likely to be closer to their xG per 90 for their remaining games than their current. \n\nNote as you say this doesn’t help fantasy managers much unless you are thinking about owning this asset for the rest of the season. Even then they could be better than the alternative especially when considered at least as a pair. \n\nEven short term (4-6 games) betting on fixture and the eye test that they continue could be better than the alternative could be a good idea.  So back to xG being little help. Being aware of the stats is useful as you are less surprised by the rate falling and over the season swapping for a player that is currently underscoring their xG / 90 especially if they have over operformed in the past (maybe indicative of a better than average finisher) have good fixtures and passes the eye test for you could be a savvy fit \n\nFor what it’s worth I’m holding Abraham and not getting Auba but this has more to with my structure, pair trades and fixtures than the xG.', 'It’s pretty simple really, you need need to work out the statistical significance of a delta xG.\n\nG = 10, xG  = 5 isn’t significant. G = 100, xG = 50 is as it’s very unlikely this would occur by chance. \n\nTo do the full calculation you can use a Poisson distribution and work out the p value. But roughly you need a few seasons data to say anything concrete about a player.', ""Thought I'd join the party here. Maybe a bit late... \n\nWhat you are looking at is a valid issue with xG data. Some players are just better finishers (Son, Hazard, KDB, Kane, Martial ). To deal with this I use a system to cautiously handle this on a chance level basis. Check out this article on the topic https://statsbomb.com/2017/07/quantifying-finishing-skill/\n\nI actually wrote up that article on how well xG data reflects goalscoring potential- this player finishing ability issue is another layer on top it! So while there would typically be something like 15% error if a match is replayed 40 times with a fixed scoring potential (due to the lack of samples), the reality is that scoring potential is transient- so the error in using a simple xG measure will be even higher\n\nI'm going to be writing up an article on the predictivity of odds, xG and other models over the next few weeks as that's what it all really bills down to- so stay tuned!"", ""I think you shouldn't have to rely on stats only.\n\nOf course it's helpful most of the time, but you have to put in context and  take the eye test into consideration as well at the same time.\n\nAnd there wiil always be a case with a totally different outcome what you expect, because of the human factors (aging, injuries, form setback e.g. Torres after L'pool)""]"

619,r/FantasyPL,cotsworthy,How is VAR affecting the stats we rely on?,"While watching the games last 2 weekends, I was surprised by the number of calls being made by VAR.

It almost feels like the linesmen, correctly, know that they don't have to make the 50-50 decisions they used to because VAR will ensure the correct decision is made.

So how is this affecting the stats we look at like shots, shots of target, chances created, xG, etc? 

Isn't a shot being recorded in the stats even if VAR rules it out as offside later? Or have the stats guys adapted already?

Obituaries

**Normal league**

This week we banish ten imposters from the realm. **You needed 36 points and a bit of luck to survive. So not much to ask really...**

1. This week's loser is **Der Sins with** ***Lastplace United***. Hooray for the relevant team name! A -12 hit netted a lowly 38 (26) points. Not only has this team come in last place, but it was also sitting pretty placed 41 in the table last week.
2. **Steve Kelsey with** ***No Groin No KravMaga*** is gone, possibly predicting our KdB predicament.
3. **Jaime Rueda and** ***Aston Huila FC***
4. **Arifa Hatiya and** ***All-Out-Attack***
5. **Mohit Tiwari with** ***Swaganu saaR***
6. **Jacob Redfern with** ***Sherwood Outlaws***
7. **Randy Lenox with** ***Durant's Alt Team*** (another -12 hitter... ouch)
8. **Mason Doyle with** ***Gylfi as charged***
9. This one gives me fantastic pleasure. My long term FIFA, Rocket League and FPL rival **Ryan Burgess with** ***Muzzy's XI*** has been dumped out. What a moment to enjoy!
10. **Emir Duraki with** ***Lokvica FC*** finishes up our rogue's gallery. Emir actually finished on the same points as Althaf Hatiya (*Gunnerz*) but loses out due to a (pretty significantly) lower points total.

**Set and forget**

Once again my S&amp;F team has continued to embarrass my 'real' team...

...anyway, this week we say goodbye to top 3 competitor **Harvey Barnes and** ***U42 Lakewood Rangers***.

The ceiling was a lot higher in this league with **46 points required this week** for set and forgetters.

**RULE INFRACTION!!!**

Sadly **Rian Byrnes with** ***BREXIT XI*** made two transfer this week which is against 'set and forget' philosophy, and thus has been ejected.

If anyone wants a refresher of the numbers by the way, this post contains is how I've worked it out (ignore the S&amp;F column - loads of people broke the rules at the start so we only have 16 combatants now):

631,r/FantasyPL,TFlatters00,Idea for mini leagues.,"As I have recently started my own mini-league for the university I just started, I encountered a problem. Some of the people that wanted to join were newbeginners, and the others had started in GW1. Therefore, it was hard to decide whether to start the league in the next GW, or from the start.  

I think it would be a good idea for FPL to implement an option where the already started teams can keep their scores, whilst the new teams get to start on an artificial score specific to that league. That way, everyone can be satisfied. The established teams don´t lose their advantage, and the new teams aren´t out before the league has even started.

633,r/FantasyPL,ImmOwen,Introducing the FPL PL CUP! The 1# Overall Ranked Team from each Premier League Club's Mini Leauge battle it out in a Champions League!,"Welcome Welcome Welcome, Have you ever wanted to know which club has the best Fantasy Premier League Players?

Let's let the results speak for themselves in this very unscientific test of wits. Using [fpl-plugin (fplugin.com)](https://fplugin.com/tournament?5e7f27e6-d950-4899-95d8-1ddafc6b2264) and a custom script I have compiled a Champions League Tournament containing the current 1# ranked players from each clubs mini-league. Their team names have been replaced with their respective club.

What's the [Format](https://fplugin.com/tournament?5e7f27e6-d950-4899-95d8-1ddafc6b2264)? 

*  Group Stage Spans: GW7 - GW12 
 * 5 Different groups of 4 teams
 * The 2 highest scoring teams from each group qualifying for the knockout stage
* Knockout Stage Spans: GW13 - GW16
 * Single Elimination H2H fixtures

[Group 1 &amp; 2](https://i.imgur.com/cTHm4gg.png)

[Group 1](https://fplugin.com/tournament?5e7f27e6-d950-4899-95d8-1ddafc6b2264): Chelsea and Arsenal top the group, not surprising as they are represented by the 7th and 5th rated players overall. Spurs are currently at the bottom of the group, maybe reflecting their current PL form, even being placed behind Norwich due to fpl points difference. Funnily enough, our representatives from Norwich and Spurs share the same overall rank of #77.

Group 1's results are not too surprising as a general rule, the larger the fan base of a club, the higher chance the player is rated well.

[Group 2](https://fplugin.com/tournament?5e7f27e6-d950-4899-95d8-1ddafc6b2264): City top the league featuring a team containing KDB, Bilva &amp; Zinchenko. City are represented by the #6 rated player. Brighton's representative on the other hand slots in 513 places behind the leaders at #519, the worst-ranked player in the tournament by a significant margin. Watford(#188) and Everton(#46) trail even though their representatives are rated hundreds of places higher than Brighton.

[Group 3 &amp; 4](https://i.imgur.com/F9BXrs7.png)

[Group 3](https://fplugin.com/tournament?5e7f27e6-d950-4899-95d8-1ddafc6b2264): Man United's(#8) woes continue, sitting in 3rd place. Southampton(#160) lead, with Leicester(#17) backing themselves for a massive 24 point Vardy captain haul. Burnley while in last, can be proud that their team features a differential call to start Joelinton, even with that Burnley are #26 OR.

[Group 4](https://fplugin.com/tournament?5e7f27e6-d950-4899-95d8-1ddafc6b2264): No top 6 feature in this group. Wolves representative, who is ranked #2 overall is unfortunately in 4th place. Palace(#398), Aston Villa(#28) and Newcastle(#79) shockingly outscored Wolves. That being said, Villa only narrowly beat out Wolves 60-59.

[Group 5](https://i.imgur.com/Ix8hG4O.png)

[Group 5](https://fplugin.com/tournament?5e7f27e6-d950-4899-95d8-1ddafc6b2264): Reality matched fantasy, as Liverpool(#3) beat Sheffield United(#19) last week in a low scoring fixture of 58-42. A West Hamless West Ham(#36) side snagged a win over Bournemouth(#122) to take first place in the group.

But where is the Number 1 OR ranked player you may ask? He did not declare support for a Club. Maybe he loves the game, the league or VAR (probably not VAR).

I plan on doing an update weekly or bi-weekly depending on interest. 

you can create your own tournament on [fplugin.com](https://fplugin.com/tournament?5e7f27e6-d950-4899-95d8-1ddafc6b2264), it's a tool I created myself and just want to share it with the world.

660,r/FantasyPL,NotAnotherAllNighter,Time for Aubameyang ?,"I always felt like Aubameyang was being overlooked this season for the likes of other more popular big hitters such as Sterling, Salah, Aguero and KDB. 

Despite Auba sitting at 24% ownership at the time of writing this, I wouldn’t necessarily see many posts here proclaiming him as being an “essential” when compared to other consistent returners. I’d even go as far as to say C Wilson has been given a greater push here on r/fantasypl 

But with Auba returning no less than 5 pts a match, and basically scoring every game he’s played (including against Man U away), is it time we start considering him as being too good to miss out on ?

The biggest problem will always be his price point at £11 mil. But I am seriously considering swapping him out for either Salah or Sterling (I have KDB who will probably start getting my Captaincy instead).

674,r/FantasyPL,RealJesseLingard,Anyone else sticking to their guns for premium midfields?,"Seen various stats, twitter threads, posts and obviously games that all have influence.

I’ve stuck with Sterling, Salah, KDB since day 1, but the arrival of other cheaper premiums such as Pepe, Son, Mane in midfield and premium options emerging up such as Aguero, Auba and Vardy make me indecisive.


Salah - plays in a top team and will be hard to get back in if he kicks off. hasn’t looked he bets but hopefully he starts banging them in soon. good things come to those who wait....?


kdb - looked absolutely insane, never selling bar injury....which he may have one now. i couldn’t care less about rotation, it evens out over time. Severely underpriced too


Sterling - probably the biggest year scratcher here. Insane player, insane team, the odd rotation but doesn’t seem to be stand out/essential anymore. KDB is more influential and maybe even explosive at the moment but £2ish mil less based on when you got each counterpart. Is it even worth have Sterling when other options are doing the same?

679,r/FantasyPL,Ottoeder,FPL-Underperformers: FC Everton,"Everyone is saying, that Everton is playing shit, but is this really true, or is it just a product of bad luck?

Let´s look at the stats:

||True Number|expected Number|Place in the league (true/exp)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Goals|6|9.93|16/8|
|Goals against|12|9.93 |16/12|
|Points|7|9.70|15/8|

So what what could be the reasons of underperforming:

* bad goalkeeping - hmm...yeah maybe pickford could have 1-2 more...
*  bad chance utilization - definitly; the opposite of clinical is ""calvert-lewin"" (i don´t know why the don´t play kean...)
* bad luck - yeah...it is bad luck if sheffield scores 2 goals from 1 chance...

Take a look at the most important players:

* Jerry Mina: Gets a good header every game....but put it next to the goal very game
* Lucas Digne: Really bad in defending so far, but still one of the most creative defenders in the league (expA90 0.20)
* Richarlison: Definitely not the Richarlison of the beginning of the last season...don´t put himself in good positions...
* Sigurdsson: Everyone says that he´s completely out of Form, but he´s still one of the most creative players so far (3th behind KDB and TAA), his set pieces are still great, and it´s not his fault if calvert-lewin wastes chance by chance...but the pressure from the fans is getting higher to rotate him with iwobi
* Calvert Lewin/ Moise Kean: Kean is looking much much more dangerous and creative, but DCL is still the preferd one...don´t know why...

So at least some questions to Everton fans:

Is Sigurdsson still nailed on?

Will Moise Kean take the main attacking spot soon?",self.FantasyPL,,1569876042.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dbaykt/fplunderperformers_fc_everton/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dbaykt/fplunderperformers_fc_everton/,29,25,25,"['FC Everton?', 'Mina the Jerry!', ""&gt; Calvert Lewin/ Moise Kean: Kean is looking much much more dangerous and creative, but DCL is still the preferd one...don´t know why...\n\nYeah you don't watch us.

With the 3 attacking midfielders you need someone to cover for them but it's not happening so they're in trouble. Silva is likely to get sacked this season based on how things stand so I'd get rid of your Everton assets and look for better options. \n\nAlso, stop looking for the bargain in Kean. He still needs time to acclimatise to the PL environment and is far from the proven prospect some other options are, don't jump onto him after his inevitable 2 goal performance vs a midtable side, it's unlikely to stay that way."", ""From someone who watches everton fairly regularly: they're just shit."", 'Not bad luck, we’re just bad', ""About Kean...

689,r/FantasyPL,isaacturon14,Adrian Replacement Thread,"Alisson is returning back to training this week, and will possibly play against Leicester, meaning all the Adrian users will need to find a replacement. The obvious answers are Pope and Ryan or Alisson if you have enough funds, but this thread is for discussing what the other good options are. I’m personally bringing in Schmeichel, because Leicester look really good defensively and they have good fixtures after Liverpool, but I’m curious who everyone else’s picks are.

Also, I’m curious if it was worth it to bring him in for all off you. He got 2 clean sheets in 4 games for me, but I also had to transfer him in and out, and took 2 hits over those 4 weeks so it didn’t work out for me in the end.

704,r/FantasyPL,mikecro2,Picks and transfers the veteran managers made this week compared to sample of top 500k GW 7 (corrected version),"Regular feature to compare the picks of  2519  FPL veterans against a sample of about 10k teams from the top 500k. Any team in my sample of top 500k which hasn't made a transfer in last 3 weeks gets excluded.

Determination of who is a veteran manager at:  https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/cqn30q/refining_the_veteran_analysis_aka_what_is_the/ 

The  2519  veterans made  5132 transfers this GW.  184 ( 7.3 %) played their wild card.
( 55 % have now already played WC)

For the picks comparison, I have filtered out the low ownership (but high ratio &gt; 1.2) players (threshold is 2%). If you don't see a player below then it will be because there is not enough ownership or the ratio is not big enough.

Raw picks data saved on Google Sheets as:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f3AHllD5Q4C7LmILZFeyczX88f4LEtzi1xEyw8OKGKU/edit?usp=sharing

I'll try to keep it up semi-regularly if you folks like it. Enjoy!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A hooded figure with upturned collars sneaks out of the Carrington Training Center, looking furtively around to see if anyone followed him. With a scarf flung around his face and a flat cap, only the street light reflecting off the edges of his bald dome that the cap couldn't cover gave any indication that this was no ordinary burglar, but *The Bald Fraud* himself in flesh.  


Half an hour of cab ride later, he knocks on the door of a dingy old building. A cardboard sign hand-scribbled with red marker hanging to the side reads **'Fraudoholics Anonymous'**.  


“Hey, you are late.”, an old guy who looks like a retired car salesman greets at the door.  


“Hard to get a cab”, The Bald Fraud, scarf still hiding his face, answers curtly.  


“Never mind now. Come on in. We have a new member today. Gary, a travel insurance agent, has joined us”, the old guy closes the door behind the Bald Fraud.  


Five of the six people already seated in chairs around the small room nod to greet The Bald Fraud who nods back in return. The new addition in an ill-fitting suit, Gary, avoids eye-contact.  


“Almost all of you know our friend here already but for the benefit of Gary here, this is one of the founding members of our 'Fraudoholics Anonymous'. He has a desire to remain anonymous and goes by the name 'Bald Fraud'.  And like each of us here, he has come here to unpack and reflect upon fraudulence he inflicts upon the lives of others.”, the old guy gives a succinct introduction and Gary smiles nervously at the fraudulent glare of The Bald Fraud's eyes.  


“Would you like to go first, Bald Fraud?”, the old guy volunteers The Bald Fraud to open up first.  


“Sure. Why not? Hi all, I'm The Bald Fraud and I'm fraudulent”, The Bald Fraud murmurs.  


“Hi, Bald Fraud”, rest of the room murmurs back.  


“As many of you already know, I have been hurting a lot of people every week. To those who don't, there is this competition I play among my fellow managerial mates, a competition where each of us has to take up some of other's playe.... umm office-workers and make a team to compete on productivity. What I do is I often sabotage my own office-workers in other manager's team so I can win. Last week, I dropped ummm... a big stapler on the second most productive guy in my office because I wanted to get ahead in that competition. This week, I asked my top guy to ummm... come into the office only after lunch as soon as I found that he was doubled down as captain by a fierce rival manager. I try not to but can't help it. I don't even know if I come here because I want to stop or gloat about it but there you go. It felt good to get that off my chest.”, The Bald Fraud bares his soul to the world for split of a second, too comfortable behind the mask of anonymity.  


“Well, that was a very honest admission, Bald Fraud. I hope expressing it all will help you to curb your fraudulence in coming days though I don't have high hopes for it.”, the old guy says with the wisdom of someone who'd heard similar admission from The Bald Fraud countless times in the past.  


“Gary, do you want to go next?”, the old guy turns towards the newest member of the group.  


Having said his peace, The Bald Fraud tunes out the rest of the meeting, instead taking out his phone and checks up on his FPL mini-league rivals. After laughing at Ole still at the bottom of the league, he silently fumes after seeing Brenda Rodgers, who was clinging to The Bald Fraud's coat-tails at the top of the league with all 32 of his shining teeth till last week, had now overtaken him with KDB captaincy.  


“Wait till next week, Brenda. I'll show you what FPL misery tastes like.”, The Bald Fraud smiles a smile that the Devil himself would've approved.  


Miles away, Brenda Rodgers, sat in front of a mirror combing his hair, is totally oblivious to what awaits his FPL team next week. Little did he know that hell hath no fury like The Bald Fraud scorned.

I believe Sterling and De Bruyne will be rested after the hour mark or so in the most ideal of situations.


Sterling is also currently facing stiff competition from Bilva who is able to slot in perfectly at left wing. And things won't look rosy once Sane is back in. The worst case scenario would be the Fraud benching Sterling once again. Do note that he was very susceptible to rotations in the past few seasons.


Gundogan might also be fully rested for the UCL with Rodri starting. 


Oh yeah I'll bet you 50 quid that Zinchenko will start over Mendy 😉

762,r/FantasyPL,2ManyPlebs,Super 5's for Gameweek 7,"[GW6](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/d6lq71/super_5s_for_gameweek_6) was a tough one for Super 5's as it saw many managers select a combination of Digne, Sterling and Dendoncker, all of whom collected 0 points. 

Unsurprisingly then, there were only 3 managers who scored in the double digits for GW6: /u/LukeSA (13), /u/joeblitzkrieg (11) and /u/thani-oruvan (10).  

/u/LukeSA's winning team for GW6 was Ryan (3), Schar (1), De Bruyne (5), Aubameyang (1) and Rico (3). He now sits 6 points clear at the top of the table after scoring a respectable 9 points in GW5. 

Luke also managed to score points for all 5 of his players, a feat only accomplished by two other managers (/u/thani-oruvan and /u/default-name-1).

**How to Play**

* Pick 1 player from each starting position - a Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder and Forward. You are not restricted by price but **none of your players (including your bench pick) can be from the same club.**

* Pick 1 bench player. **Must be priced at 4.1 or below for a Goalkeeper/Defender, or 4.6 for a Midfielder/Forward.** Lundstram is 4.4 for example and can't be picked.

If you break either of these rules you will be awarded with a 0 for the cheapest player that breaks said rules. I will post a format in the comments.

**Scoring**

You score points based on how well your players perform. For the 4 starters:

* 4-6 points awards you +1 

* 7-9 points nets you +2 

* 10 points or more is +3

For the bench player:

* +1 for 1 point, +2 for 2-3 points, and +3 for 4 points or more. 

On top of this, if one of your starters finishes the gameweek in the dream team he will net you an additional +2 points. If your bench player finishes in the dream team he will net you +7 points.

He was always a standout player.\n\n""He doesn\'t always look sensational when he moves because of his height but he grew and developed with the team.\n\n""In a world of big transfer fees, signing a player like Joel on free is incredible. Probably one of the best pieces of business we did in the last few years.\n\n""He is in a really good moment. Long may it continue - that would be really cool.""', ""Hes a least a million cheaper than the full backs and Van Dijk. So not a bad idea if you're looking to invest in a premium forward or midfielder instead"", ""He's been better than VVD imo. Should've won a penalty and has been involved in set pieces. I'm doubling with Robbo and Matip but probably wildcarding soon to just TAA. I don't think gomez or lovren are threatening Matip right now, he's playing really well."", 'I have him for now, but he will be replaced soon with likes of Aurier, Tierney. I actually will have to watch Tomori.', ""Just a word of warning, one of the main reasons I'm cool on him.. His injury record for us has been terrible until the last 12 months. I feel like he's due a spell on the sidelines and I fully expect Gomez to grab any opportunity with both hands and become VVDs partner again should this happen."", ""I had VVD until today and toyed with switching out for Matip to gain a substantial fund for other transfers but went for TAA instead and swapped out Haller for Abraham as well (I had 0.8m spare) .  I may rue my decisions come Tuesday. I'm not super confident of getting any higher in the league than I am now as it's the highest I've ever been since whenever this game started.  I'm ranked 4218 atm."", ""I feel the prices of Liverpool defensive assets this season is just a tad too high (except matip). In order to have a premium Liverpool defensive asset you need to make some quite big sacrifices up the field, sacrifices I feel don't outweigh the cost. You can get yourself an absurdly mental midfield and attack by sacrificing having vvd, Trent or robbo. On top of that Liverpool have only kept one clean sheet so far which sways me even more considering they have some less good fixtures coming up."", 'Ok, he keeps his place in my draft team']"

791,r/FantasyPL,stlouis777,FDL - team H2H tournament!,"Hello everybody! Hi, guys!

Dear mates, we are glad to present a unique format of Fantasy Battle – **Fantasy Draft League** (FDL)!

*Here we go – main rules of tournament:*

**1.** **FDL – is a team tournament**

* Teams we completed as in common FPL Draft: 1-2-3-3-2-1. Every captain had to choose one FPL manager per round.

**2.** **H2H (head-to-head) competitions and new scoring**

* Every manager should complete certain number of h2h-competitions in Fantasy Premier League
* Manager gets 1 Fantasy Point (FP) if his sum of FPL points is more than sum of his opponent.
* Manager doesn’t get any points if he loses h2h-duel.
* Both managers gets 0.5 point in case of draw.
* Than we get the sum of individual points of managers in one team. Team that has more points wins (in duel against other team).

[Review of 1 and 2 gameweek  ](https://i.redd.it/zd3mhmn2v3p31.png)

* All chips and non-free transfers are included in scoring.
* Team gets 3 points for winning in a single gameweek; 1 point for draw, 0 points for lose.

[Tournament table for today](https://i.redd.it/0wptsfa1w3p31.png)

**3. Team can CAPTAIN MANAGER!**

* The most incredible thing in FDL – team can captain manager and he gets double points, if he wins!

&amp;#x200B;

[ Dark-gray lines: these are captains of teams. Captain of team “A” lost his duel and got 0 points. Captain of team “B” got 2 points \(1\*2\) because he won h2h-duel.](https://i.redd.it/jkpk8yaax3p31.png)

* Before the GW deadline every team should name his captain.
* We make rating of managers after every GW. We count “luck/unluck” of managers and so on.

[ Rating of managers. Sorted by FP \(Fantasy Points\)](https://i.redd.it/ti5l4pywx3p31.png)

You can get more information about FDL [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSaIEN6kXebL4jgvCaRyiiXtKrK5cMUGLhciUdsV2T_c2-rQFDjFbDpSundE-Y02YM5dI_OAFAJHIuQ/pubhtml#)

This is the first such tournament. Something like beta-version.

Please, write us if you have any questions.

We hope you enjoyed this. Good luck everybody, mates!

P.S. We want to create a tournament with a similar format for everyone, but without a draft. You can create a team with your friends, for example.

[GW7 Top Captain Choices](https://i.redd.it/u5d63m9ql3p31.png)

There are a few players in contention for captain picks this GW, it’s arguably the most difficult captain choice of the season to date.Mo Salah is the current top projection &amp; also the bookies most likely midfielder to score this GW away against Sheffield. Not far behind him is Harry Kane who is the mostly likely player to score with an implied probability of 54.4% of scoring against Southampton. However both of these players have arguably been slow to start and many will be hesitant to select them on that basis.Aguero, Sterling, Vardy, Son, Firmino &amp; Abraham are alternatives with positive projections for the weekend.

&amp;#x200B;

[DFs](https://i.redd.it/0483wn54m3p31.png)

Schmeichel is the top projected keeper with a nice fixture at home against Newcastle. Familiar names Ederson, Lloris, Kepa and Adrian follow him. Heaton and Pope are the best value keepers of the week (ignoring Adrian).The best defensive projections of the GW are dominated by Liverpool and Leicester. Soyuncu looks incredible value this week and beyond in particular. Pereira was a popular pick at much lower price last season and is second to Trent Alexander-Arnold.

Salah and Sterling lead the midfield projections as usual. Son, Mane &amp; KDB are the other best projected premium options. Zaha, Mount &amp; Fraser are the value names in the top 10- though there may be doubts about Frasers play-time.Up front Kane, Aguero &amp; Vardy lead the charge. Abraham, Jimenez, Pukki, Haller and Wilson could all be in for promising weeks at a more affordable price.GW7-14 Optimised £100M Selection

# 

[GW7-14 Optimised Squad](https://i.redd.it/lzucs27gm3p31.png)

Schmeichel, Soyuncu, van Dijk, Kante &amp; Abraham are now preferred to Leno, Maguire, Digne, Kayal &amp; Jimenez withy the remainder of the optimised long-term picks staying as per GW6.

Martial retains his spot in the team, though many of us are rightly worried that he may have disappeared and Ole simply doesn’t have the heart to share this info. If you do not believe this conspiracy he remains a good long-term pick.

The team is starting to look very interesting as confidence in new faces has increased and value options have emerged.

# GW7 £100M Team of the Week

&amp;#x200B;

[GW7 Optimised Team](https://i.redd.it/ik8k8goxm3p31.png)

An overall quite exciting selection for this GW.Defensively Leicester players are favoured as they have the highest implied probability of a clean sheet of the week. TAA also seems worth every penny and makes the selection as does his temporarily good value team-mate Adrian.The midfield is filled with potential with Salah, Son, Zaha and Mount all providing a goal threat. Up front Kane and Abraham are two of the best picks of the week and Greenwood may get his chance at a start if Martial is out. Let’s see how it works out!

# Development Corner
