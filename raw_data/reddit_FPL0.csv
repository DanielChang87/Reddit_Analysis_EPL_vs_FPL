4,r/FantasyPL,tongueinloftuscheek,I've got a problem with my TWAT and I need your help.,"You may or may not have heard that I used to do a post on this subreddit called the TWAT.

Of course, 'TWAT' is an acronym. It stands for The Worst Active Team. In a nutshell, I analysed the lowest scoring team in the top10k in any given gameweek. It won the Pulitzer Prize for literature and, perhaps even more prestigiously, was endorsed by Richard and Judy's book club. I don't want to be *that* guy but, suffice to say*,* it was a pretty big fucking deal.

Until it stopped.

But I'd like to dust her off, grease her up and get her back on the road.

I've received several requests, and even a Twitter DM from Judy herself (nudes attached).

Got one issue though - this is where you come in.

The site I used to get my data from (fpldiscovery) has ceased operations over the summer. 

Wondering if anyone knows where I might be able to find the lowest scoring manager in the top10k after each gameweek. Or if there's anyone on here with the skills to extract that data themselves.

Any help with my problemed TWAT would be appreciated.

9,r/FantasyPL,pm_me_tidy_code,Picking a captain for gameweek 9 - Bayesian multilevel model,"Evening FPL,

I have posted the gameweek 9 version of my Bayesian multilevel model - now with informative priors! - [on my blog](https://mbarnfield.github.io/fpl.html). I've copied the full post here. It's a bit of a basic reintroduction to the idea behind model and how it works, with this week's results (two versions) at the end.

With the international break over, it's time to pick an FPL captain for gameweek 9. I have been running a Bayesian 'captain selection model' every week that attempts to model a captain picking logic to rank players by how good a captain they are for the upcoming gameweek. It is a multilevel model, factoring in that players are clustered within teams. I run it in [`brms`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/brms.pdf), in `R`, using data from gameweek 25 last week up to the most recent gameweek. I get these data from [vastaav](https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League). The basic syntax of the model looks like this:

`points | weights(weight) ~ player + opponent + home + minutes + (1 | mm(team_1, team_2))`

`points` is simply the amount of points a player gets each week, `player` is a vector of player names, `opponent` is a player's opponent each week, `minutes` is how many minutes a player plays each week, and the `(1 | mm(team_1, team_2))` part is the multilevel component, factoring in that some players have played for more than one team over the course of the data. `weights(weight)` assigns more weight to more recent gameweeks, essentially making it so that the most recent gameweek (8) is treated as happening 1.5 times, whereas the first gameweek in the data (gameweek 25 last season) is treated as only having happened once. This weight increases exponentially by week, with a big leap occurring between the two seasons, so that gameweek 1 this season is weighted much closer to gameweek 8 this season than it is to gameweek 38 last season.

The model is based around predicting points, because it is the player with the highest points that is the best captain choice. However, I don't claim to be building a model that optimally or accurately predicts points. The players are ranked by predicted points, but the specific points values themselves aren't particularly meaningful. It is about how well the players should be expected to do, relative to each other, before we see this week's data. What I'm seeking to do is represent a thought process I think most players go through when picking a captain, which I spoke about in my first post. Basically, I think we use the following heuristics:

1. Class: which of my players is the best?
2. Form: which of my players is on the best form?
3. Fixture: which of my players is playing the worst team?
4. Venue: which of my players are playing at home?
5. Game time: which of my players will get 90 minutes?

Sometimes, this thought process doesn't leave us with a clear captain pick. I designed this model because, using the data directly, it can work out how we would expect each player to do, given who they are, who they play for, who they're up against, where they're playing, and how many minutes they'll get. So when this thought process doesn't give us a clear answer, because for instance we might have a week where Agüero is at home against Watford and Salah is at home against Norwich, the model can give us a more objective idea of the probable performance of each player. The fixture, venue and game time are accounted for by `opponent`, `home` and `minutes`. Form is built into the model through the weights, which mean that the model assigns more weight to players' performance in more recent gameweeks. These things, and class, are relevant both at the player level and at the team level --- we want to pick good *players* who are doing well, have a good fixture, are ideally at home, and are going to get plenty of minutes, but we also want players who play for good *teams* which are on form.

Class is to an extent naturally built in by the fact that I use data back to midway through last season, but it is also relevant to how the *priors* are set in the model. The model is a function of players' average price throughout the second half of last season and so far this season. As price is determined by likely performance and ownership, the variability in the prior captures how well we would expect each player to do without seeing the data. The model listens quite a lot to these priors at the moment, because I assign them a standard deviation of only 0.5. I do this to prevent the data listening excessively to the data, in which there are still considerable anomalies that skew the estimates. This is done to factor in the fact that people generally seem to choose their captains from among the premiums, so a model of captaincy selection should favour such players unless it has very good reason not to. I'm just trying to do what we do heuristically, more mathematically.

## Results

The results of the model for this week are below. Players nearer the top are estimated to have a higher probable points value this week, so are better captain picks. Note that there is a lot of uncertainty in how these players are ranked, captured by the fact that their credible intervals (the range in which we are 95% sure, based on the data, that their points value will fall) overlap a lot. There is really no meaningful difference between Mané and Agüero. This is where, if you have other considerations or intuitions, these could sway your choice one way or the other. The implications of the international break might be relevant here, for example.

The first plot assumes players play the average amount of minutes they have played over the last five gameweeks. There is therefore some variability in the minutes here. The second plot assumes that all players whose average minutes are over 45 play 90 this week. The estimates change because some players might have one prediction based on a 60 minute appearance, and another on a 90 minute appearance. Because I model minutes, the model knows that 90 minutes usually means more points than 60 minutes. Notice the difference in how De Bruyne is ranked, for example. He is a great pick if he plays a significant proportion of the match, but his average minutes over the last five gameweeks are relatively low. I think he was also red-flagged, in which case he might not be worth the risk. Again, here, the international break might be really relevant in a way I can't model. If you're convinced that Sterling won't play 90 because he played twice, then maybe don't captain him. The model doesn't have this data, but you might.

Two positions were all that were left [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/diubp2/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_v_final_2_positions). Voting was close throughout but in the end it was Maddison and Firmino who take it, just beating out Yarmolenko and Aubameyang for the final 2 places! With these two new additions we finally have our 15-man squad and all that's left to do is to give you one final say on what happens to the team before the captain and bench vote tomorrow evening.

**Final Changes**

This is it. If there is something you are not happy with or things have changed and you want to make adjustments, this will be your final opportunity to suggest any number of changes you want to make to the team. There will be a poll vote held tomorrow with the most popular options. 

Please reply directly in the comments with any changes you want. In your comment you are welcome to suggest as many changes as you like. You can include multiple transfers, formation changes and changes to bench personnel all in the same comment. Heck, change all 15 players if that's what you want. We leave it entirely in your hands. 

*Note - You have £0.3m ITB to work with and it's worth mentioning there are already 3 players from Chelsea in the team, so if you do want a different Chelsea player you will first need to take one out.*

#How to Play

You post your predictions for each fixture in the format specified (e.g. `Manchester United v Crystal Palace (2-1)`) and you are awarded points as per the following:

A correct result (e.g. 1-0) = 1 point

A correct score (e.g. 2-1) = 3 points

You will be awarded either 0, 1 or 3 points (with a maximum score of 3 points) per fixture.

So in the hypothetical fixture above, if the match ended 2-1 and you had predicted 3-2 to United, you would be awarded 1 point. 

If you predicted 2-1 to United, you would be awarded the full 3 points.

If you predicted a draw or a Palace win, you would score 0 points.

[**You can see a more detailed explanation of the rules here.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/cmvubh/predictions_league_gw1_thread/)


#GW9 Fixtures and Format

* Everton v West Ham (H-A)
* Aston Villa v Brighton (H-A)
* Bournemouth v Norwich (H-A)
* Chelsea v Newcastle (H-A)
* Leicester v Burnley (H-A)
* Spurs v Watford (H-A)
* Wolves v Southampton (H-A)
* Crystal Palace v Man City (H-A)
* Man Utd v Liverpool (H-A)
* Sheffield Utd v Arsenal (H-A)


Each prediction must be in the following format:

* `Home Team v Away Team (2-1)`

This is because /u/hi-i-am-new-here
's Excel macro expects predictions in this format and ignores everything else. 

The most important parts of each prediction are the hyphen (`-`) and the brackets (`()`). 

Please do not use colons (`:`) or other brackets because the macro is not looking for these.

The order is the next most important thing because e.g. if you post your Burnley v Southampton prediction before the Bournemouth v Sheffield Utd fixture, then the macro will take your Burnley v Southampton prediction as your Bournemouth v Sheffield Utd prediction.  

In previous seasons, predictions not fitting this format and order have been manually corrected but this will only be the case this season in very rare exceptions. You are responsible for your own predictions.
