0,r/FantasyPL,DoTheRax,Average of GW 9 is higher than the average of GW 8.,"Can someone please explain to me how this gw's average is higher than the previous gw? Despite highly owned players like Mane and Abraham exploding. Also despite returns from Burnley defenders, Mount, Lundstram, a cheeky TAA bonus in the previous gameweek, we have a higher gw average this week with literally no one who is significantly owned returning/exploding except a 5, 6, and 8 from Sterling, Lundstram and Robbo. I really don't understand the maths behind this.",self.FantasyPL,,1571732313.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dl9liy/average_of_gw_9_is_higher_than_the_average_of_gw_8/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dl9liy/average_of_gw_9_is_higher_than_the_average_of_gw_8/,10,2,2,"['The difference is only one point though, both weekends weren’t great.', 'Aguero and salah owners got screwed over.

1,r/FantasyPL,QuickyGaming,Lundstram would have scored points 34 if he was correctly categorized as a midfielder.,"These calculations will be really long, there's no real purpose in it other than to be a filler so this post doesn't get removed. Also the bonus points might have been different but I'm not sure how to calculate them.

Note: Lundstram is currently on 45 points in his current, miscategorized state.

GW 1: BOU (A) - 2 points for playing 77 minutes, 1 bonus point = 3 points

GW 2: CRY (H) - 2 points for playing 90 minutes, 5 points for 1 goal scored, 1 point for a clean sheet, -1 point for a yellow card, 3 bonus points = 10 points

GW 3: LEI (H) - 2 points for playing 90 minutes, -1 point for a yellow card = 1 point

GW 4: CHE (A) - 2 points for playing 90 minutes = 2 points

GW 5: SOU (H) - 2 points for playing 77 minutes = 2 points

GW 6: EVE (A) - 2 points for playing 90 minutes, 3 points for 1 assist, 1 point for a clean sheet, 3 bonus points = 9 points

GW 7: LIV (H) - 2 points for playing 90 minutes = 2 points

GW 8: WAT (A) - 2 points for playing 90 minutes, 1 point for a clean sheet, -1 point for a yellow card = 2 points

GW 9: ARS (H) - 2 points for playing 90 minutes, 1 point for a clean sheet = 3 points

3 + 10 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 9 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 34 points.

34 points would still make him one of the best midfield bench fodders available.

15,r/FantasyPL,chapalang,"Salah, De Bruyne , Mane and Sterling","Which 2 of the 4 would you guys pick and why?

Salah being the last 2 seasons points leader and being on pens seems to make him a must have over the others but recently hit a rough patch and has many transferring him out. However going without him makes you prone to missing out on massive hauls.

Mane seems to be similar to Salah but at a lower price point might seem more value.

De Bruyne definitely the most popular option this season, current points leader and looking like an absolute essential in City’s side. Although he didn’t return this week he still influential and was unlucky not to return despite coming off an injury.

Sterling similar to Salah, second biggest goal threat for the best side in the Premier League (up for debate), Prone to rotation though although less so then Aguero.",self.FantasyPL,Discussion,1571692557.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dl0eb6/salah_de_bruyne_mane_and_sterling/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dl0eb6/salah_de_bruyne_mane_and_sterling/,81,40,40,"[""Currently sitting on Mane, De Bruyne.

23,r/FantasyPL,aurorabortrealis,Brief discussion of Solskjaer's 3412 vs Liverpool.,"Posting this to hear people's thoughts on the Utd v Liverpool game.

I'll start by saying that any discussion may be for nought, as I'm not expecting this to become United's default formation going forward.

Solskjaer's main reason for going with 3 centre backs was so they could directly match up with Liverpool's front 3. I believe this would have been the case regardless of whether Salah played or not. 

The wingbacks (AWB and Young) were instructed to press TAA and Robertson in the attacking half, then drop in to form a back 5 in the defending half. Mctominay and Fred were fairly defensive, with their main role being to track the late runs of Wijnaldum and Henderson, and to screen the defence when dropping into 5ATB.

The front 3 didn't press too aggressively. Pereira's primary goal was to block the pass to Fabinho, in an attempt to force Liverpool to play long. In attack, they rotated well and looked to get in behind the full backs before squaring the ball, as we saw for the goal.

The strenght of the formation was the ability to man mark all over the pitch. Origi in particular struggled to find space, while Mane had a little more joy against Rojo.

The weakness of the formation was offensively. Van Dijk and Matip didn't have too many issues with Rashford and James, who had to chase a lot of balls in behind for little reward. The inability of 2/3 of the centre backs to play out from the back hindered United's attack.

AWB and Young didn't have many opportunities to get into crossing positions. Young's crossing was predictably poor. AWB seemed to hesitate before crossing a few times, which meant they were blocked. As his decision making gets better I would expect him to improve here.

As expected, Rashford and James had most of their success on the counter attack, but struggled against a set defence. From an FPL standpoint, I still worry about United's ability to score against teams who set up defensively and look to counter.

Liverpool really struggled to break down the defence, having to resort to a lot of long balls and deep crosses. Personally I was pretty disappointed that TAA wasn't more aggressive, while Robertson had a lot more success, despite going against the stronger defender. Origi spent most of his time camped on the wing, while Mane was looking to roam and get on the ball, similar to how Salah plays when healthy, but with limited success. 

Conclusion: this wall of text may be for nothing, as I don't really expect United to persist with 3 centre backs. But I thought it was interesting how it was very effective at shutting down Liverpool's attack. Remember how much Liverpool struggled against Sheffield United's back 3.

I think it's clear that Rashford needs to play either on the left or with a strike partner, and not alone up top. This formation gives him that partner, and, to a degree, the opportunity to cut in from the left and not leave the penalty box a vacuum, since he and James seemed to split towards the wings every chance they got.\n\nThings will look different, and hopefully better, with Pogba, Shaw, and Martial back to full fitness, mind. I'm curious to see how we'd function if we went with a 3-4-1-2 or a 3-4-3 more often in games. Lindelof, Maguire and Tuanzebe as the three, McT and Pogba in the middle, Shaw and AWB as the WBs, and James/Rash/Martial upfront. It's not a bad template honestly and can't be worse than we've been doing with the 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 or whatever the fuck it is we had before this.\n\nAnd the best part of it all is...

Really good analysis and food for thought.

TAA was especially frustrating trying to play long balls to Mane and Origi from deep in their own half. Everything was cut out by United’s 3 CBs. United did great to pressure early, and what Liverpool really needed to do was control the possession and try not to let the Old Trafford crowd get in their head. Instead, AWB absolutely shut down Robertson on the wing and United broke down the right two or three times with really dangerous looking attacks. Mostly by releasing James in behind Robertson.\n\nUnited seemed to tire out a lot in he second half but Liverpool could not string three passes along despite having 60+% possession. Firmino had no joy without Salah Liverpool’s only real goal threat was Mane, who was utterly neutralized except for the VAR episode. \n\nReally, the only way United we’re going to score in that game was on the counter and Liverpool played into it. The goal came from Robertson overrunning Origi and then Origi losing the ball very cheaply. \n\nI think teams have pretty much figured out Liverpool are vulnerable on the counter attack, but I can’t help but think that if Salah was fit, the game would have gone very differently.']"

Apologies if this has been answered before or if there’s a really easy way to find out and I’m just being lazy...

However, depending on circumstances, even if a player's price drops, the price one is able to sell that player at may not change.

Example. I bought Pukki for 6.8m, if was price was initially 7.1m, I could sell him for 6.9m. If his price drops to 7.0m, I can still sell for 6.9m. So when his price dropped from 7.1m to 7m I didn't need to make a quickfire decision to sell before the drop.

Edit: it's based on the premise that for evry 0.2m rise above the price paid, the selling price increases by 0.1m

48,r/FantasyPL,gongersio,Agüero?,"Seems like he isn't nailed and there might be better options like Auba. Or is it worth keeping faith in him because City score so many goals? Is Sterling potentially a better option? I've had him 3 weeks and he's been benched twice(and blanked once). I don't really know what to do with him so I wanted to hear what other people are going to do with him.






Filler:
Agüero moved to Premier League club Manchester City in July 2011 for an undisclosed fee thought to be in the region of £35 million. On the last day of his debut season with the club, he scored a 94th-minute winner against Queens Park Rangers that earned City its first league title in 44 years. At the end of the 2015–16 season, of players who had played at least two seasons in the Premier League, Agüero had the highest goals per minute ratio in the history of the competition since its formation in 1992, averaging a goal every 106 minutes, ahead of Thierry Henry.[6] He also holds the joint-record for the most goals scored in a single Premier League match – five – and the fastest to do so, in 23 minutes and 34 seconds of match time.[7] In November 2017, Agüero became Manchester City's all-time highest goal-scorer, scoring his 178th City goal against Napoli.[8] Agüero is currently the 6th highest goalscorer in Premier League history, and the highest non-European scorer in the history of the Premier League, with 170 goals in the division.

Often considered to be one of the best strikers in the world,[229] Agüero is regarded as an all-out centre forward,[230] but can also play as a second striker off another striker, which he often did at Atlético Madrid with Diego Forlán,[231] due to his passing ability, tactical intelligence, and vision, which made him a capable assist-man.[232] When asked to name the players who influenced his playing style, Agüero named former Brazilian striker Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Ronaldinho and Diego Maradona as the best players to have played the game, but said that the player who influenced his style of play the most was “the Brazilian Ronaldo”.",self.FantasyPL,Discussion,1571589108.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dkgyzb/agüero/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dkgyzb/agüero/,16,0,0,"['Pep barely ever drops aguero for home games .

49,r/FantasyPL,SebastianOwenR1,Some interesting differential picks have begun to arise.,"This is especially important for those of us looking to escape some collapsing players. Teemu Pukki for instance. 

There has been huge buzz recently around Callum Hudson-Odoi. The youngster has returned from injury, and since that return has been crucial to Chelsea’s attack, scoring once and assisting 3 times in 4 appearances (1 league cup), and could be moving into good form.

Along the lines of a Pukki replacement, you may look at premium choices like Vardy, Wilson, and Jimenez, but performing just as well recently is former Liverpool striker Danny Ings (5.9 mil), who has scored 6 and an assist across all competitions for Southampton, and earlier on in the season put one in the net against his former team (albeit off of a mindless fault from Adrian.) His fixtures are scary but will be looking up in a few weeks, and he’s proven he can score against the odds. 

A midfield option who appears to be taking the spotlight from the beloved John McGinn is his teammate Jack Grealish. Fixtures also remove some of the palatability of this option. The man has clocked 4 goals and 4 assists in competition this season. He appears to be benefiting off of a tactical change at Villa, and is playing strong, promising football. 

Another option is the steady, reliable Youri Tielemans. He proved once again yesterday that he isn’t just good for assists, and he has amazing fixtures in the future, and benefits from in form teammates. 

I know I mentioned Jimenez as a premium option earlier, but then you realize that despite starting with a 35% ownership at the start of the season, Raul Jimenez has dropped below 10%. And then immediately struck form. He scored in the Europa League match before the IB, and assisted 2 against city in Wolves’ win, before scoring the drawing penalty yesterday. His form is starting to look up, and we know that the man has points in him, evidenced by last year. 

Tomori returned some today, as did Wood, and both may be mentionable, but I’ll wait for another week. These are just some interesting inclusions i thought I’d bring up. Good luck to all, and may the point drought begone.

TL;DR: Ings, CHO, Grealish, Jimenez (yes technically a differential), Tielemans. They doing neat things. Look at em.",self.FantasyPL,Discussion,1571587224.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dkgq9b/some_interesting_differential_picks_have_begun_to/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dkgq9b/some_interesting_differential_picks_have_begun_to/,44,89,89,"[""Dear lord don't waggle the glass man Ings in front of me......fine player and ability but a brisk winter breeze might injure him as soon as I transfer him in."", 'Mate paragraphs please, this felt like one huge sentence to read', 'I really wish I had waited to do my wildcard.', 'Guilbert has also been under the radar recently. Good player.', 'They change like the wind , more concerning is Mounts minutes and Kovacic fine 2nd half performance', 'Having checked the number of points left on my bench over the past months, I can confirm that Ings gets points and also that he typically gets them against the odds.', ""Like the Jimenez pick, especially as everyone seems to be jumping on Wilson and Vardy. Think he might sneak under the radar. Big question mark is Europa League. but Wolves seem to have found a way to cope with it recently. \n\nWas in interesting reminder of Alonso's capability yesterday, only 3.5% owned and with great fixtures could be one to add to the list - but at a price. If Harvey Barnes manages to nail down a place he'd be straight into my team. Three assists and 16 points in his last three games despite only managing 180 of the 270 minutes. Would put him at eight points per 90 minutes, but even 50% of that would be great value for 5.9 and only 0.3% ownership..... But sadly he'll never nail that place."", '* I wish i had bought CHO instead of Maddison...Maddison looked not too bad and yes he´s maybe a bit more nailed on, but CHO was simply amazing.

**In Summary**

We’ve seen the effects of injuries, Champions League, Carabao Cup ties, bad performances and the international break on Pep’s thinking on this and while there may be no strong correlation there is an interesting pattern. 

- Laporte (6.3) went out vs Brighton, Pep had to adjust and forced KDB to play in a deeper role while Fernandinho would be shifted to CB as what happened vs Watford

- Playing in other competitions doesn’t always correlate into being benched in the Premier League but it did for Sterling vs Watford. He played every league game and at Shakhtar as well as for England which meant Guardiola rested him.

If there’s any pattern you notice, please respond. It took me a while after watching the Crystal Palace game to find the statistics.

70,r/FantasyPL,mikecro2,Picks and transfers the veteran managers made this week compared to sample of top 500k (GW9),"Regular feature to compare the picks of  2519  FPL veterans against a sample of about 10k teams from the top 500k. Any team in my sample of top 500k which hasn't made a transfer in last 3 weeks gets excluded.

Determination of who is a veteran manager at:  https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/cqn30q/refining_the_veteran_analysis_aka_what_is_the/ 

The  2519  veterans made  4984 transfers this GW.  268 ( 10.6 %) played their wild card.
( 67.3 % have now already played WC)

For the picks comparison, I have filtered out the low ownership (but high ratio &gt; 1.2) players (threshold is 2%). If you don't see a player below then it will be because there is not enough ownership or the ratio is not big enough.

Raw picks data saved on Google Sheets as:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pyZgfphwSCRcdFmfZtGsZvpkFDLdzMK73yLMJMBuJeQ/edit?usp=sharing

There was only one other who finished on double digits, /u/workaccount567, who scored a respectable 10 points in GW7. Team of Kepa (1), TAA (1), Son (1), Vardy (5), Dendoncker (2). They also scored joint top in GW5 with 11 points which was the first week this game started. 

You needed 7 points or more to finish in the top 10% for GW7. 

There was no Super 5's in GW8 as I did not have the time to post. Everyone has been awarded a 0 for that gameweek.

**How to Play**

* Pick 1 player from each starting position (GK, Def, Mid &amp; Fwd). You are not restricted by price but none of your players (including your bench pick) can be from the same club.

* Pick 1 bench player. Must be priced at 4.1 or below for a Goalkeeper/Defender, or 4.6 for a Midfielder/Forward. Rico is 4.2 for example and can't be picked.

If you break either of these rules you will be awarded with a 0 for the cheapest player that breaks said rules. I will post a format in the comments.

**Scoring**

You score points based on how well your players perform. For the 4 starters:

* 4-6 points awards you +1 

* 7-9 points nets you +2 

* 10 points or more is +3

For the bench player:

* +1 for 1 point, +2 for 2-3 points, and +3 for 4 points or more. 

On top of this, if one of your starters finishes the gameweek in the dream team he will net you an additional +2 points. If your bench player finishes in the dream team he will net you +7 points.

112,r/FantasyPL,Top_Claim,"Thoughts on Premiums-Sterling, Aubameyang, Aguero, Vardy, Son","Interested on the opinions for these 5 premiums. I think most of us are keeping Salah or Mane for the whole season along with KDB if healthy as of right now. Who is the next agreed premium?

Sterling- 12.1 still has great underlying stats even though hes on a lower scale for returns in comparison to Aguero and Aubameyang. Also he seems to be playing slightly wider this season and without KDB's magic there seems to be a lack of something to break down defenses from city. Also Pep roulette could strike at anytime which is always a concern unless Bsilva is in fact banned which remains unknown.

Aubameyang- 11.1 First blank of the season last gw but hit the post versus Bournemouth. Always in the mix for Arsenal, might be forced out wide left with Laca back this week or next but works well with him. Good underlying stats and less rotation, likely to play every game unless injured.

Aguero-12.2 Highest scoring forward in FPL and has appeared in every game starting or off the bench. Only one blank this season. Jesus poses a threat to his position albeit hasn't looked great in the prem compared to Aguero but maybe Pep saves Aguero for champs league. City are also at a point where they cannot afford to drop more points and with some big fixtures upcoming maybe Aguero is more nailed on as Pep will want to play his best players?

Vardy- 9.0 price tag always makes a difference in comparison saving 2.0 or 3.0 minimum. Has been clinical with his chances albeit not great attacking stats from him or Leicester in general but could that be down to their fixture difficulty at the start of the season and now with all of their upcoming green they can show what their attack can do?

Son-9.8 Spurs play Watford next but Son could be out or starting on the bench as he had a long travel from North Korea. Has looked dangerous and ready to score but can we trust Spurs currently for 9.8 if he isn't for sure going to start against one of the worst teams currently in the league?

Double up- throwing this in here for a discussion on either double pool or city if you believe they are fixture proof.

Other Premiums- Pepe, Laca, Firmino",self.FantasyPL,,1571442546.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/djpdxj/thoughts_on_premiumssterling_aubameyang_aguero/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/djpdxj/thoughts_on_premiumssterling_aubameyang_aguero/,25,14,14,"['Auba being forced out wide, he was leagues top scorer playing with Laca most of the Time so he shouldnt have problems sxoring', 'I just want Pepe to be successful. Is that too much to ask? (Non-owner)', 'I have Auba, Sterling, Mane &amp; De Bruyne so surely things work out for me...', 'In my opinion (which isn’t worth much as I’m distinctly average at fantasy football):\n\nSalah - Still the best pick on the game. Most likely to get a huge haul and in the absence of Milner is on pens.  Greedier and more clinical than Mane. Confident he will outscore Mane comfortably come the end of the season. \n\nSterling - Still a great pick and along with Salah most likely to get a huge haul even if he might have the odd blank or be rested. I’d choose him over Aguero. \n\nKDB - If fit, a must have at that price. Best footballer in the premier league. \n\nAuba - stats are good and often tempted by him but never quite willing to take the plunge. I could be wrong but seems to get few assists. Once Laca is back I can see his points dropping off slightly. That said, he will consistently score as he’s a proven goal scorer. 20+ for the season. A safe pick. \n\nAguero - I just don’t trust he will not be rested a fair amount especially as he gets older. I’d rather spend the money on Sterling who I think is more nailed. Jesus is a talent and could start to fulfill his potential soon. Injury prone. That said he is capable of hitting 4 in a game... if Pep roulette doesn’t scare you, go for it. \n\nSon - Solid pick but a bit streaky. A luxury pick. Last seasons price was a no brainer. This season I’m not sure he’s worth it. \n\nVardy - Not for me at £9million\n\nKane - I don’t have him and it scares me. He will come good and if he stays fit is the best goal scorer in the league. There’s 3 players capable of a 5 goal haul in the league in my opinion. Kane, Salah, Aguero. I think Kane is the most likely to go big in Andy Cole, Andy Shearer style.  \n\nIf Manu were to get Allegri in I’d even throw Pogba &amp; Rashford into the mix of big hitters 😂', ""Made a bit of a shuffle this week and took out Salah to bring in Aguero.  \n\nSome few weeks a season I think I have Pep's rotation figured out. It would make sense to start Aguero and rest Jesus, who's been on international duty. It would then also make sense to let Jesus play the CL and League Cup matches in between the next PL matches. Having a fit and starting Aguero for home games against Villa and Southampton would be a dream.  \n\nDreams however, often turns to nightmares, and so does my team every time I do a big reshuffle. Every season I take out someone who returns the favour with a hat trick the next game. Cue a massive Pukki/Salah weekend."", 'Maybe not as clinical then but gets himself into more positions to score. Since Salah has been at Liverpool he’s got a lot more points than Mane. So must have something on him. \nFair opinion on Aguero. I’d just personally prefer Sterling and KDB and wouldn’t wanna triple up.', ""In the end of the season Sterling will finish with higher score than KDB but I don't know whether in terms of return also. So for me the question is when he starts playing and getting points. \nI don't know actually why but I just don't believe in Vardy this season. \nSalah also seems indispensable in the end to me.""]"

Wilson is still only owned by 13.4% compared to the next lowest owned from this analysis (Auba, 28.2%).\n\n*[Stats from fantasyfootballhub members area, u/Ottoeder goalscorer odd post and FPL website.]*"", ""Form can easily change over a 2 week intl break, so that's a bit unreliable.\n\nFixture differential should be weighted more heavily, IMO.\n\nAnd Home/Away does have value."", 'How is palace almost thrice as difficult compared to Sheffield?

We are almost at the finish line but there is one final poll for you to complete before our Wildcard team is locked in. Here is how the team looks at the moment:

**[Kneejerk United (3-4-3)](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/2000323/history)**

Pope (4.6) - McGovern (4.0)

TAA (7.2) - Soyuncu (4.7) - Tomori (4.6) - Rico (4.2) - Lundstram (4.2)

Sterling (12.1) - De Bruyne (9.7 / **Y**) - Maddison (7.2) - Mount (6.7) - Cantwell (4.9 / **Y**)

Firmino (9.6) - Wilson (7.9) - Abraham (7.7)

ITB: £0.3m

**Y** = Yellow Flagged (75% chance of playing)

**Final Changes**

In the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dj9y04/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_vi_final_changes) you guys were given the opportunity to suggest any number of final changes to our Wildcard team. All valid options are included: 

**Option 1 - [Sterling to Mane](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dj9y04/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_vi_final_changes/f4334pt)**

**Option 2 - [Tomori/Soyuncu &amp; Cantwell to Tierney &amp; Dendoncker](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dj9y04/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_vi_final_changes/f4316ov)**

&gt;Tiny part of me wants us to downgrade Cantwell to a 4.4 so we can just about squeeze Kieran Tierney in as a differential gamble 

**Option 3 - [Firmino &amp; Wilson to Aubameyang &amp; King](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dj9y04/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_vi_final_changes/f444r93)**

&gt;Personally I feel Wilson to King is not a massive downgrade, but Firmino to Auba is a decent upgrade. 

**Option 4 - [Cantwell, Firmino &amp; Wilson to Mane, King &amp; Connolly](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dj9y04/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_vi_final_changes/f42wx2h)**

**Option 5 - [Tomori, Sterling, Cantwell &amp; Firmino to Lowton, Mané, Hudson-Odoi &amp; Vardy](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dj9y04/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_vi_final_changes/f44er1h)**

**Option 6 - [Pope, Rico, Sterling, Cantwell &amp; Firmino to Gazaniga, Kelly, Mane, Dendoncker &amp; Aubameyang](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dj9y04/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_vi_final_changes/f4365i2)**

**Option 7 - [Pope, Tomori, Sterling, Cantwell &amp; Firmino to Gazzaniga, Webster, Mane, Dendoncker &amp; Aubameyang](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dj9y04/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_vi_final_changes/f42s4um)**

&gt;You get coverage across all the major attacks (LIV - Mane, City - KDB, ARS - Auba, LEI - Maddison, CHE - Mount/Abraham). Firmino to Auba is a big upgrade while Mane is pretty much lateral from Sterling. Wolves have a really nice run of fixtures and Dendoncker should get a bunch of clean sheet 1 pt bonuses.

&gt;Gazza gives you a top 6 keeper for super cheap and Webster has been starting for a decent Brighton defense. In a week or two you could upgrade Gazza or Webster to a 4.5 with the remaining money. 

**Option 8 - No Changes**

131,r/FantasyPL,Mik-Hail-tal,Why KDB hasn't dropped in price.,"Because I'm bored at work and I'm reading a lot of comments on this sub that 'the FPL prices are being manipulated by the evil FPL-towers', I'd like to share my thoughts on the situation.

I don't know the algorithm that decides the price changes,nobody seems to know, but here's what I think happened. I repeat: what I think happened.

""Nobody is essential"" is a quote that some people on this sub like to spread and they are correct in this way that there will most likely always be a team you can create without that ""essential player"" and still rank OR 1. But in reality, some players are simply must-haves and KDB was proving this. 2 goals, 9 assists and 10 bps for a total of 63 points in 7 fucking games, at that pace he would break Salah's record season easily. The man is an animal and he was priced at a mere 9.500.000 to start the season so he started rising, a lot.

Mount, Abraham &amp; Pukki are the only ones with more price rises than KDB since the start of the season and they all cost +/-3.000.000 less at the moment. KDB managed to rise 5 times, even though it's harder to fit him in. On top of that he came back from a long injury, still has some injury issues right now ánd plays for the bald fraud, but still he had 5 price rises. These are facts. 

I don't know the exact numbers of what I'm about to say but what **probably** happened was this:

KDB was close to his 6th price rise the day his injury news got spread, let's say +98. After the news came out, people started selling him and he started dropping.. and dropping.. and dropping..   
He dropped all the way to -98, meaning he fell 196.  
But you need to drop all the way to -100 to drop in price so he managed to survive. The 196 is relatively low but this is because of the wildcards that notoriously happen a lot during international breaks and this time wasn't an exception. Wildcards don't affect price rises.   
So let's say for example he would've been at +50 at the time the injury news spread and this wasn't an international break so the 196 would've been a lot higher, he could've easily dropped 2 times and the conspiracy theories would've been buried.

On top of that I honestly fail to see what the FPL-towers could possibly have to gain by manipulating the price of a player, in a free to play game , by 0.1 or 0.2

Now put those tinfoil hats in the trash and acknowledge the fact that selling KDB for Mahrez, who was horrible vs Wolves and got subbed in the 59', or Son, who blanked vs Brighton and might get benched vs Watford, was in hindsight, a bad idea. No need to search for conspiracies.

TL;DR  KDB didn't drop because he was close to a price rise when the injury news leaked so had to drop around 190 to get to 1 price drop. The fact that he didn't manage to drop that deep, even though he almost made it, was because of the wildcards that notoriously happen a lot during international breaks.",self.FantasyPL,,1571421710.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/djlapj/why_kdb_hasnt_dropped_in_price/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/djlapj/why_kdb_hasnt_dropped_in_price/,54,79,79,"[""There's definitely something in the algorithm that requires much more transfers out than normal for a flagged player to drop in price."", ""&gt;I don't know the algorithm\n\nThe emphasis here should go to 'algorithm', cause that's the important word differentiating to a simple mathematical formula that everyone then goes on to assume. There could be many steps in there with many conditions that we simply don't know. It's easy to have combinations of conditions that are met only once a year or have even never been met yet, that change the thresholds for price changes, by just having enough conditions. They could even use factors in there that we do not take into account making it even more complex.\n\nThere's no point in trying to explain every such case or for people to go into conspiracy theories because we just don't have anywhere enough information/statistical sample.  \n\n  \n\nEdit: Corrected to '**simple** mathematical formula'"", 'The fun part is that people who took him out, will actually have to hurry to get him back because he will start rising again soon.', ""I'd think form affects price changes quite heavily.

In a certain way', 'Or maybe the algorithm factors in points made last X games, so a player that has been scoring a lot of points needs a lot more transfers than normal to drop in price', ""I have a suspicion that the flag colour changing could affect the transfers out needed price changes.

Similar pattern happened with Martial who also hasn't dropped.\n\nMaybe a flag change is a bit of a reset switch, but I have little substantial evidence to back that up."", 'Explain the maddison miraculous price rise.', 'maybe out of the subject maybe not but if there is no such thing as what we call it FPL gods ""towers"" who control prices WHEN NEEDED then why lovren didn\'t drop in price last season for like a 10gws?  that\'s only one example of many .']"
132,r/FantasyPL,mario1301,The Case for Janmaat,"This won't be for everyone but I've noticed his name has not been mentioned in r/FantasyPL this season so I think it's worth providing a bit of background on big Daryl.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start with the cons:

* Watford have the third worst xGA in the prem
* Second most conceded team (20 goals)
* Has only played 280 mins and hasn't produced anything offensively
* Past 3 fantasy seasons averaged around the 50pts mark
* Next 3 games:  tot, BOU, CHE,

Now with the pros:

* The geezer is £4.3m
* Started 3 out of the last 5 including 90mins in the last two games (not sure why he didn't start at the beginning of the season)
* Has the potential to grab a couple goals/assists within a season
* 3 bonus pts in his last outing

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not suggesting to start him week in week out. However, if you strategy this season is similar to mine where you are trying to fit as many big hitting mids and fwds as possible, I think he could be another way to free up some funds.

My defence consists of Rico, Lundstram, Janmaat, Soyunci and Kelly, rotating these five and praying for game time and clean sheets has freed up funds for KDB, Sterling, Mane, Vardy, Firmino and Abraham.

That £0.2m made a big difference for my wildcard and even though Watford are shit, I'm banking on my heavy hitters to make up for that.",self.FantasyPL,,1571420390.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/djl3vx/the_case_for_janmaat/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/djl3vx/the_case_for_janmaat/,25,15,15,"[""I actually started the season with Kiko in a rotation because going forward he looked to have assist potential.

What site is most accurate for this season for projecting price changes?

I used to use FISO as it gave a very helpful net transfers in/out statistic so you could see the rate of change, not just whether a player was close to a price rise or fall but not sure how accurate it is this season.

146,r/FantasyPL,pm_me_tidy_code,Picking a captain for gameweek 9 - Bayesian multilevel model,"Evening FPL,

I have posted the gameweek 9 version of my Bayesian multilevel model - now with informative priors! - [on my blog](https://mbarnfield.github.io/fpl.html). I've copied the full post here. It's a bit of a basic reintroduction to the idea behind model and how it works, with this week's results (two versions) at the end.

With the international break over, it's time to pick an FPL captain for gameweek 9. I have been running a Bayesian 'captain selection model' every week that attempts to model a captain picking logic to rank players by how good a captain they are for the upcoming gameweek. It is a multilevel model, factoring in that players are clustered within teams. I run it in [`brms`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/brms.pdf), in `R`, using data from gameweek 25 last week up to the most recent gameweek. I get these data from [vastaav](https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League). The basic syntax of the model looks like this:

`points | weights(weight) ~ player + opponent + home + minutes + (1 | mm(team_1, team_2))`

`points` is simply the amount of points a player gets each week, `player` is a vector of player names, `opponent` is a player's opponent each week, `minutes` is how many minutes a player plays each week, and the `(1 | mm(team_1, team_2))` part is the multilevel component, factoring in that some players have played for more than one team over the course of the data. `weights(weight)` assigns more weight to more recent gameweeks, essentially making it so that the most recent gameweek (8) is treated as happening 1.5 times, whereas the first gameweek in the data (gameweek 25 last season) is treated as only having happened once. This weight increases exponentially by week, with a big leap occurring between the two seasons, so that gameweek 1 this season is weighted much closer to gameweek 8 this season than it is to gameweek 38 last season.

The model is based around predicting points, because it is the player with the highest points that is the best captain choice. However, I don't claim to be building a model that optimally or accurately predicts points. The players are ranked by predicted points, but the specific points values themselves aren't particularly meaningful. It is about how well the players should be expected to do, relative to each other, before we see this week's data. What I'm seeking to do is represent a thought process I think most players go through when picking a captain, which I spoke about in my first post. Basically, I think we use the following heuristics:

1. Class: which of my players is the best?
2. Form: which of my players is on the best form?
3. Fixture: which of my players is playing the worst team?
4. Venue: which of my players are playing at home?
5. Game time: which of my players will get 90 minutes?

Sometimes, this thought process doesn't leave us with a clear captain pick. I designed this model because, using the data directly, it can work out how we would expect each player to do, given who they are, who they play for, who they're up against, where they're playing, and how many minutes they'll get. So when this thought process doesn't give us a clear answer, because for instance we might have a week where Agüero is at home against Watford and Salah is at home against Norwich, the model can give us a more objective idea of the probable performance of each player. The fixture, venue and game time are accounted for by `opponent`, `home` and `minutes`. Form is built into the model through the weights, which mean that the model assigns more weight to players' performance in more recent gameweeks. These things, and class, are relevant both at the player level and at the team level --- we want to pick good *players* who are doing well, have a good fixture, are ideally at home, and are going to get plenty of minutes, but we also want players who play for good *teams* which are on form.

Class is to an extent naturally built in by the fact that I use data back to midway through last season, but it is also relevant to how the *priors* are set in the model. The model is a function of players' average price throughout the second half of last season and so far this season. As price is determined by likely performance and ownership, the variability in the prior captures how well we would expect each player to do without seeing the data. The model listens quite a lot to these priors at the moment, because I assign them a standard deviation of only 0.5. I do this to prevent the data listening excessively to the data, in which there are still considerable anomalies that skew the estimates. This is done to factor in the fact that people generally seem to choose their captains from among the premiums, so a model of captaincy selection should favour such players unless it has very good reason not to. I'm just trying to do what we do heuristically, more mathematically.

## Results

The results of the model for this week are below. Players nearer the top are estimated to have a higher probable points value this week, so are better captain picks. Note that there is a lot of uncertainty in how these players are ranked, captured by the fact that their credible intervals (the range in which we are 95% sure, based on the data, that their points value will fall) overlap a lot. There is really no meaningful difference between Mané and Agüero. This is where, if you have other considerations or intuitions, these could sway your choice one way or the other. The implications of the international break might be relevant here, for example.

The first plot assumes players play the average amount of minutes they have played over the last five gameweeks. There is therefore some variability in the minutes here. The second plot assumes that all players whose average minutes are over 45 play 90 this week. The estimates change because some players might have one prediction based on a 60 minute appearance, and another on a 90 minute appearance. Because I model minutes, the model knows that 90 minutes usually means more points than 60 minutes. Notice the difference in how De Bruyne is ranked, for example. He is a great pick if he plays a significant proportion of the match, but his average minutes over the last five gameweeks are relatively low. I think he was also red-flagged, in which case he might not be worth the risk. Again, here, the international break might be really relevant in a way I can't model. If you're convinced that Sterling won't play 90 because he played twice, then maybe don't captain him. The model doesn't have this data, but you might.

#How to Play

You post your predictions for each fixture in the format specified (e.g. `Manchester United v Crystal Palace (2-1)`) and you are awarded points as per the following:

A correct result (e.g. 1-0) = 1 point

A correct score (e.g. 2-1) = 3 points

You will be awarded either 0, 1 or 3 points (with a maximum score of 3 points) per fixture.

So in the hypothetical fixture above, if the match ended 2-1 and you had predicted 3-2 to United, you would be awarded 1 point. 

If you predicted 2-1 to United, you would be awarded the full 3 points.

If you predicted a draw or a Palace win, you would score 0 points.

[**You can see a more detailed explanation of the rules here.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/cmvubh/predictions_league_gw1_thread/)


#GW9 Fixtures and Format

* Everton v West Ham (H-A)
* Aston Villa v Brighton (H-A)
* Bournemouth v Norwich (H-A)
* Chelsea v Newcastle (H-A)
* Leicester v Burnley (H-A)
* Spurs v Watford (H-A)
* Wolves v Southampton (H-A)
* Crystal Palace v Man City (H-A)
* Man Utd v Liverpool (H-A)
* Sheffield Utd v Arsenal (H-A)


Each prediction must be in the following format:

* `Home Team v Away Team (2-1)`

This is because /u/hi-i-am-new-here
's Excel macro expects predictions in this format and ignores everything else. 

The most important parts of each prediction are the hyphen (`-`) and the brackets (`()`). 

Please do not use colons (`:`) or other brackets because the macro is not looking for these.

The order is the next most important thing because e.g. if you post your Burnley v Southampton prediction before the Bournemouth v Sheffield Utd fixture, then the macro will take your Burnley v Southampton prediction as your Bournemouth v Sheffield Utd prediction.  

In previous seasons, predictions not fitting this format and order have been manually corrected but this will only be the case this season in very rare exceptions. You are responsible for your own predictions.

Two positions were all that were left [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/diubp2/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_v_final_2_positions). Voting was close throughout but in the end it was Maddison and Firmino who take it, just beating out Yarmolenko and Aubameyang for the final 2 places! With these two new additions we finally have our 15-man squad and all that's left to do is to give you one final say on what happens to the team before the captain and bench vote tomorrow evening.

**Final Changes**

This is it. If there is something you are not happy with or things have changed and you want to make adjustments, this will be your final opportunity to suggest any number of changes you want to make to the team. There will be a poll vote held tomorrow with the most popular options. 

Please reply directly in the comments with any changes you want. In your comment you are welcome to suggest as many changes as you like. You can include multiple transfers, formation changes and changes to bench personnel all in the same comment. Heck, change all 15 players if that's what you want. We leave it entirely in your hands. 

*Note - You have £0.3m ITB to work with and it's worth mentioning there are already 3 players from Chelsea in the team, so if you do want a different Chelsea player you will first need to take one out.*

167,r/FantasyPL,tongueinloftuscheek,I've got a problem with my TWAT and I need your help.,"You may or may not have heard that I used to do a post on this subreddit called the TWAT.

Of course, 'TWAT' is an acronym. It stands for The Worst Active Team. In a nutshell, I analysed the lowest scoring team in the top10k in any given gameweek. It won the Pulitzer Prize for literature and, perhaps even more prestigiously, was endorsed by Richard and Judy's book club. I don't want to be *that* guy but, suffice to say*,* it was a pretty big fucking deal.

Until it stopped.

But I'd like to dust her off, grease her up and get her back on the road.

I've received several requests, and even a Twitter DM from Judy herself (nudes attached).

Got one issue though - this is where you come in.

The site I used to get my data from (fpldiscovery) has ceased operations over the summer. 

Wondering if anyone knows where I might be able to find the lowest scoring manager in the top10k after each gameweek. Or if there's anyone on here with the skills to extract that data themselves.

Any help with my problemed TWAT would be appreciated.

---

In the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/di9ypo/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_iv_picking_2/), we asked you to select 2 of our 3 starting forwards. We received some very good suggestions but you guys showed the most love to **Abraham (155 votes)** and **Callum Wilson (90 votes)**. 

This leaves us with only 2 positions to fill for our wildcard team - a starting midfielder and a starting forward, both of which we will be selecting today before we move onto the final changes. 

---

Here's how we're shaping up:

**[Kneejerk United (3-4-3)](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/2000323/history)**

&gt;Pope 

&gt;TAA - Soyuncu - Tomori 

&gt;**Mid 1** - Sterling - De Bruyne - Mount

&gt;Abraham - C.Wilson - **Forward 3**

BENCH: McGovern, Cantwell, Rico, Lundstram 

#ITB: £17.1m

---

**Post your suggestions for the 2 positions directly in the comments below**. You can put forward any combination of 2 players you like as long as you **stay within the budget (£17.1m)** and **include a forward and a midfielder in your comment**. 

The most upvoted suggestion will be implemented.

201,r/FantasyPL,cokecap91,"Can Tottenham backup GK Gazzaniga (4.4) prove to be a good, cheap FPL choice for starting GK with Lloris out for a long time?","Hoping some Spurs fans, or anyone, can provide some insight into this. 

1.) I know Spurs brought back Michel Vorm, but is Gazzaniga still first choice when Lloris is out? 

2.) Also wondering how Gazzaniga has performed in the past when having to step in to cover for an injured Lloris? Anyone know if he’s ever even gotten a clean sheet for Spurs?

I know Tottenham have only kept one clean sheet so far this season, but having a cheap 4.4 GK that starts for one of the big 6 clubs sounds too good to pass up. Much like any other cheap GK, I’m thinking of picking him under the assumption that a clean sheet here and there along with the occasional save points should hopefully make him worth it.

## FPL PL CUP

It was a low scoring one even for the best of us. Looking at you Liverpool! 

### Group 1 (Arsenal, Chelsea, Spurs &amp; Norwich)

Arsenal had the highest score this week, with 57. They lead the group with 6 points, their representative is now #2 OR. No other representative managed to score 50+ points!

*Shame, Shame, Shame..*. was that a GOT quote or a Norwich Chant? If you had a bad week imagine getting 34 points while using your FREE HIT. Norwich: 0 Group Points.

 
Spuds^(W) and Chelsea^(L) both sit on three points after their clash. That will teach the Chelsea representative that nobody captains a Spurs player twice in a row and gets away with it.

### Group 2 (Brighton, Watford, Man City, Everton)  

Cause I'm Mr. Bright~~side~~ton, last time I use that joke for a while. Brighton are on cloud 6... 6 points after smacking down Man City 43-29. Everton manages to be boring in this tournament and in real life, managing a solid 0 points in the group. 

### Group 3 (Leicester, Southampton, Man Utd, Burnley)

Props to the Burnley representative, 2 weeks into the tournament and has grabbed a grand total of 66 points. Dropping from #3 OR to #194. United left dunks massive 10 point haul on the bench which would have guaranteed a place in top 5 OR. It's a competitive group.... unless of course, you support Burnley.


### Group 4 (Crystal Palace, Aston Villa, Newcastle, Wolves)

Group 4 is really a group of two. So, for now, I will call it Group 4/2. The only group where two teams are undefeated. You would expect that our Vila representative cashed in big-time of 5-1 win over Norwich. Well, you sir are wrong. McGinn hauled for 1 point. This weekend we have the leaders and losers battling it out. So keep your eyes on this group.


### Group 5 (West Ham, Sheffield Utd, Liverpool, Bournemouth)

Sheffield took some time away from the farm to score ""big"" with 41 points. Well, size is relative... amm I, right? Liverpool, the fortress, undefeated run, going to win the champos, pl, fa cup, league cup..... They scored a meager 21 POINTS. That is a game week rank of 6,499,149. shocking FROM NUMBER #3 OR. FYI, the representative didn't have a bad team. He left 26 points on the bench! Let this be a warning.

---

In the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dhucpw/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_iii_finalizing_the) we got you to select our final 2 defenders. They were starting defenders and it was not a very close vote. In fact, the two winners received 5 times as many votes as the next preferred options.  
TAA (134 votes) and Soyuncu (111 votes) complete our defence and this now only leaves 4 players to select before we can move onto final changes. 

---

Here's how we're shaping up:

**[Kneejerk United (3-4-3)](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/2000323/history)**

&gt;Pope (4.6)

&gt;TAA (7.2) - Soyuncu (4.7) - Tomori (4.6)

&gt;Mid 1 - Sterling (12.1) - De Bruyne (9.7) - Mount (6.7)

&gt;**Forward 1** - **Forward 2** - Forward 3

BENCH: McGovern (4), Cantwell (4.9), Rico (4.2), Lundstram (4.2)

ITB: £32.7m

---

So with the defence and goalkeepers out the way and 4 mids already selected, it's time we turn our focus to the front line. We'll be selecting Forward 1 and Forward 2 today, with the final forward along with the final midfielder being decided in tomorrow's post. 

At this stage there is £32.7m ITB and that is our entire budget for the final 4 starters. If you go for something like Auba (11.1) and Vardy (9) it will leave £12.6m for the final 2 positions. We're not saying that's a problem, it is entirely up to you where you spend the money, but if you do want more than budget options for the remaining positions then you'll need to keep the budget in mind when voting today as spending big now may mean certain options are not possible later.

**With all that said, please reply to our comment below with your options for Forward 1 and Forward 2. The top two options will be implemented.**

247,r/FantasyPL,404randomguy404,Kneejerk United - Wildcard Part III: Finalizing the Defense,"Welcome back to the 2019/20 edition of r/FantasyPL's hive mind team! An exercise in which you, the members of this sub, select and maintain an FPL team throughout the course of an entire footballing season.

---

In our [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dhe2rd/kneejerk_united_wildcard_part_ii_the_bench_and/), we asked you to make some very important decisions for our wildcard team. Arguably the most important one was to find out what is the community's take on Salah vs Sterling. Do we want both of them, only one or neither? That was the question posed to you in our last post and the hive mind has given its decision - **Sterling stays in our wildcard team by winning the poll with 39% of the votes**. 

As for the Fodder Keeper poll, **McGovern was the clear choice with 63% of the votes**. 

We also asked you to give suggestions for a bench midfielder &amp; a bench defender. Out of all the suggestions, **Cantwell &amp; Rico were the highest upvoted ones so they both will be joining our team.** This concludes our bench with all the 3 spots filled.

---

So this is how our wildcard team is shaping up, 


[KNEEJERK UNITED](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/2000323/history)

3-4-3

&gt;Pope - McGovern

&gt;**Def 1** - **Def 2** - Tomori - Lundstram - Rico

&gt;Mid 1 - Sterling - De Bruyne - Mount - Cantwell

&gt;Fwd 1 - Fwd 2 - Fwd 3

ITB: 44.6m


---

We've got 44.6m worth of funds to play with and we're left with 6 positions yet to be filled. We figured that completing the defense first should be the best move as we expect it to not require a lot of our budget. It will also help us in getting a clearer idea about how our forward line will look like and if we can fit any premium there or in the midfield. 

So today, we are going to complete our defense by picking the 2 starting defenders for our 3 at the back formation. **Please reply to our comment below with your options for Defender 1 and Defender 2**. The 2 most upvoted suggestions will be selected for the team. 

Do keep in mind that there are still 4 starters left to pick after today so the more you save now the more will be left for these positions (Midfielder 1, Forward 1, 2 and 3) in the next posts.

255,r/FantasyPL,SimpleKancha,"[Shitpost] A Parable of The Bald Fraud, Volume VII - The Man in the FPL Towers","Previous Post in the Series: Volume VI, Viral Fraudulence https://redd.it/dgh587  

------------------------------------------------------------------------  

The pub was poorly lit and sparsely populated. At a corner table, The Bald Fraud was taking his time sipping a Bloody Mary, occasionally glancing at the entrance.  

He was waiting for a guy named Brandon, an employee at FPL Headquarters, algorithm department. He had built quite a stellar reputation for himself when it came to price manipulations, and his work behind the scenes in preventing last year's Lovren price drop was a testament to his efficiency.  

The pub door swings open and a nerdy-looking guy in glasses rushes in, scans the interior and walks towards The Bald Fraud.   

“Oh hey, Brandon. Glad that you could make it”, The Bald Fraud greets the visitor.  

“I'm on lunch-break and can't spend too much time. Have you brought what I asked for?”, Brandon pulls up a chair and plops himself down.  

“Yes, Yes; its all in here. How's work in the FPL Towers? Busy?”, The Bald Fraud passes a package in a brown envelope to Brandon.  

Brandon accepts the package and takes a peek inside.  

“This looks light, Pep. I charged Klopp 50 grand for Lovren price-lock last year and I made myself clear over the phone that KDB's would be double that. If you try to get fraudulent on me, it won't end well for you Pep. Take my word for it”, Brandon is in no mood for small talk.  

“Hey, I would never shortchange you, Brandon. Why would I? I have my mini league on line here. Half the managers in my league dropped Kevin, the greedy bastards. I can't let him go down”, The Bald Fraud defends himself.  

“I looked over the data, Pep and it doesn't look good. A lot more people are selling KDB than I thought. I have to manipulate all kinds of injury flags and what not and it still may not be enough. There are more eyes on me too, especially after I misclassified Lundstram at the start of the season. I have very real chances of getting caught this time. I can't be doing all that and also watch over you, Pep. If you fuck me over payment, I never work with you again.”, Brandon lays out the rules of the game out to The Bald Fraud.  

“You said 100 grand, I gave you that. Don't try to wriggle out of the deal now, Brandon. Maybe I sweeten the deal next time but that's all I have with me for now.”, The Bald Fraud wasn't going to be dragged into renegotiating a finalized deal.  

“Okay, okay. I didn't know it would be this tough though. I'll do my best. At worst, it could be 0.1 drop. Are you okay with it?”, Brandon wants to have some wiggle room.  

“Hell; no. No way I pay you and you still let Kevin drop. Kevin stays at 10.0 even if he fucking breaks his legs or the deal's off. Do you understand that? You don't get to fuck me and ride away into the sunset, Brandon. I'll fuck you back”, The Bald Fraud bellows.  

“Alright. Calm down. Jesus.”, Brandon is taken aback by The Bald Fraud's ferocity.  

“I don't care about Jesus's price. I just want Kevin price-locked”, The Bald Fraud gets further distressed.  

“I've got you covered, Pep. KDB's price won't fall. My break's over and I gotta get back to work. Nice doing business with you”, Brandon gets up to leave.  

“Same here, Brandon. By the way, that Lundstram thing was your masterpiece. I'm a big fan.”, The Bald Fraud, no longer upset, tries to cajole Brandon with flattery.

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

Does anyone know already if there are going to be teams playing multiple fixtures in the same gw yet or do we still have to wait for league/ fa cup matches/weather to potentially change it?,self.FantasyPL,,1571086118.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dhq3f2/double_triple_captain/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dhq3f2/double_triple_captain/,24,4,4,"[""I assume you're fairly new to FPL or at least to this sub.\n\nYou'll get a lot of tasteless jokes from this subreddit's veterans. Even the guys that were in your position last year.\n\nWhat you're proposing has been the most popular strategy for the TC chip - wait for the double fixtures, then pull the trigger. On paper, it's the most effective way to use it - much like the bench boost if you have more than 11 DGW players.\n\nPersonally have had mixed experience with a TC on a DGW as many players tend to be rotated as the tight schedule spells fatigue. A lot of people learned this with TC Sane last season while Aguero scored a handful vs Chelsea.\n\nIf you're using your TC on a DGW, be sure that your player is immune from Pep fraudulence (TC Sane intensifies) and they're not injury prone. Also make sure that it isn't snowing and they don't have the sniffles (looking at you, Kane!!!)."", ""There aren't double game weeks during the Christmas periods. There are weeks when teams play twice, but these are 2 short seperate game weeks. The double game weeks come later in the season (GW 30something) when games are rearranged due to cup games.\n\nI remember last season some people saw 2 games in a week around Christmas time and played their chips then thinking it was a DGW, make sure you're not one of these this year. When the DGW and BGWs roll around you'll definitely know about it from this sub.\n\nLiverpool/West Ham have a blank game week GW18 but the double to make up for that will be GW31/32 IIRC"", 'In my experience Bench Boost and Free Hit have been the best chips to use on double gameweeks. Double Gameweek is a great time to make up for a poor start and push for top of your ML. \n\nLast year there were three doubles. Many people used TC on Sane in the first double for a whopping 3 points. The most common chip strategy for the next two was free hit the second double, then wildcard a week before the third double and bench boost during the double while rolling a free transfer for after the double. I remember I got 137 points using the bench boost. \n\nIf you think of a double gameweek on a games played/player basis, if you use free hit you can choose 11 players who will play twice, for a total of 24 games played (captain essentially plays 4 games worth). Using bench boost after a wildcard gives you potentially 32 games played. Using triple captain gives your captain 6 games worth of points, but there’s no guarantee the rest of your team will have the double fixture. The effective games played for TC will then range from 13-26 depending on how many players have a double. It is also notoriously difficult to plan for the double gameweek as it often isn’t finalized until a week in advance. It should be pretty clear that bench boost is the ideal chip to use on a double gameweek, assuming the majority of your players actually have a double. If your triple captain blanks, you basically gained 4 points by the chip. If everyone on your bench boost blanks, you gained ~16 points with the chip (assuming all playing doubles 60+ mins etc).\n\nTriple Captain imo is best used in a plum fixture toward the end of the season, when shit teams have already been relegated. For example Norwich play away to Man City in the last match of the season this year. Depending on how the league table is, it could be a must win game for City, and they will want to utterly demolish Norwich after losing to them 3-2.\n\nOf course, like normal gameweeks, it doesn’t really pay to get too cute and outthink the meta. For example last year Brighton had a back to back double gameweek. A lot of people on here tripled up with Brighton (most common combination I think was actually Ryan, Dunk, Duffy) They lost both of the first two matches heavily and their defenders came out with like 4 points between the whole back line. It turns out that fpl is a bit like the stock market: A shitty company with an interesting product is still just a shitty company (shoutout to WeWork). \n\nTldr, the TC chip is probably the weakest chip to use on a DGW. Other chips spread the risk and value much more and enable a solid team. This is also all my opinion and I suck at fpl.', 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zKXCX4BoizwHdARVHbIYNvZr7GcE0QBNqktUiFtsjg8/edit?usp=drivesdk', ""I'd recommend Sane"", ""In addition to what everyone has said, try to ensure you follow Ben Crellin on Twitter.\n\nHe has a pretty good track record with identifying potential upcoming GWs, permutations around when etc. \n\nAs of now, there's only one confirmed blank but as we near GWs 27/28, you'll definitely start seeing some more activity around who will have the doubles and when. \n\nThe strategy on its own has given me very mixed results. The only thing last season taught was unless you plan to TC Laporte during the DGW, don't captain any other defender."", 'Good strategy.Just don’t use one of the city players as your captain. Pep will somehow make sure to rotate him out.', 'Yes. But if you think that Duffy or Dunk would be great asset at double gw, no.']"

261,r/FantasyPL,dimitros89,Wilson vs Vardy and the forwards dilemma.,"I will say the typical that this is not an RMT and believe many of us will face(or are currently facing) this dilemma soon. Deciding to have/keep Abraham in your team is an easy one. Keeping or dropping Pukki is a matter of deciding if you want to give him one more chance. Having Auba/Aguero depends on your team's formation/tactics(having Premium on top, having(or not having) Sterling/KDB etc).  Of course, another decision to make is if it's worth to go with 3 starting forwards having in mind the big variety of good choices in midfield in all price ranges.

And finally, the big selection dilemma in my opinion is Wilson or Vardy for the upcoming fixtures. I will try to share the pros of each one in respect to each other and hope to hear your opinions as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Wilson

1. Costs 1.1 mil less
2. Leaky defences in the upcoming fixtures, especially the next 2(Norwich, Watford)
3. Higher goal and expected goal involvement
4. Plays for an attacking team
5. Has better stats

Vardy

1. Is usually the focal of most of his team's goals(although Wilson has a higher contribution rate so far this year, King is expected to share goals with him).
2. Theoritically easy opponents in the upcoming fixtures and proved to be a flat track bully this year.
3. Has less BPS but gets bonus easier, probably because of having big hauls more often
4. Plays for a better team
5. Does not need many chances(or good stats) to score",self.FantasyPL,,1571069475.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dhnjop/wilson_vs_vardy_and_the_forwards_dilemma/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dhnjop/wilson_vs_vardy_and_the_forwards_dilemma/,72,50,50,"['Vardy is on pens.

 **Some clusions you can get from these tables:** 

* **Conolly** had outstanding stats against Spurs, but it was just one game. But at 4.5 he´s worth a punt...
* **Ayew** seems to be the most bargain nailed on forward, not bad for bench-fodder i think
* **Maupay** and **Wesley** have nearly the same stats, both could be good punts, but Maupay has the better fixtures
* **Wood** has better stats than **Barnes** (the reason why i have named just him)
* **Pukki´s** stats are really good, the first games he had a lot of luck, the last few he had bad luck...so i´ll stay with him for now, because he´s also very creative.
* **Haller** seems to be a good pick, his stats are nearly the same like **Aubas** (!). OK he´s not as clinical, but maybe he´s getting better ;-)
* **Abraham** seems to be a must-have. His stats are simply outstanding in his price-class! Maybe he´s the best forward in the game atm.
* **Wilson** is also not a bad pick. His stats are not as good as Abrahams but with NOR and WAT coming up the next two weeks ;-)
* **Vardy** and **Kane** are not worth their money according to the stats. Maddison´s goal threat is nearly equal to Vardy´s. So you better have a 7.2 midfielder than a 9.0 forward. Bad Spurs form affects Kane. He has to drop deep to get balls. Think the main Problem is that Eriksen has already gone in their minds and Alli is completely out of form...
* **Firmino** seems to be also a very good pick. He´s playing in a playmaker/striker-role with a lot of creativity. He may not get the golden boot, but he´ll pick up a lot of assists during the season...
* **Kun´s** stats are outstanding as you see! But it´s your decision if you want to pay 12.2m for a injury-prone player, who´s maybe get rotated with Jesus every second or third game...

272,r/FantasyPL,404randomguy404,Kneejerk United - Wildcard Part II: The Bench (and Salah vs Sterling),"Welcome back to the 2019/20 edition of r/FantasyPL's hive mind team! An exercise in which you, the members of this sub, select and maintain an FPL team throughout the course of an entire footballing season.

---

Carrying on from the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dgyqi3/kneejerk_united_wildcard_activated), we asked you to choose which players from the current team you wanted to keep. The threshold we had in mind was 10%, but this can vary depending on the amount of players you wanted to keep in the squad, and voting was close so we can't know that for certain (yet). 

The results from yesterday's poll are as follows:

**Pope (12%)** - ~~Button (5%)~~

~~VVD (2%)~~ - ~~Digne (0%)~~ - ~~Otamendi (4%)~~ - **Tomori (10%)** - **Lundstram (15%)**

~~Salah (7%)~~ - ~~Sterling (9%)~~ - **KDB (14%)** - **Mount (14%)** - ~~Dendoncker (1%)~~

~~Pukki (2%)~~ - ~~King (2%)~~ - ~~Greenwood (1%)~~

Players in bold keep their place in the squad. 

---


Keep in mind it is not a perfect system but it does give us some idea of the players you want to keep/drop. As there is no certain way to know from this if you wanted to keep the next closest, Sterling (9%) and Salah (7%), we figured we would just ask. [This was requested in the previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dgyqi3/kneejerk_united_wildcard_activated/f3h7465) and the players do take up a considerable amount of the budget so it's worth finding out from you now.

* **[Poll 1 - Salah, Sterling, Neither, Both](https://www.strawpoll.me/18782539)**

---

**The Bench**

We also asked for your preferred GK pricing structure and you decided on Budget + Fodder (76%). As Pope keeps his place in the team, all that's left to decide is the bench GK. All fodder goalkeepers have been included in the poll. They all cost £4.0m.

* **[Poll 2 - Fodder Goalkeeper](https://www.strawpoll.me/18780955)**

Finally, we move onto the outfield bench players. Based on the formation you selected in the previous post, 3-4-3 (60%), our team will have a bench comprising 2 defenders and 1 midfielder. As Lundstram is already in the team that leaves 1 defender and 1 midfielder to select. **Please reply to our comments below with your options for a Bench Defender and a Bench Midfielder**. 

The most upvoted suggestion for each position will be picked for the team.

Some clusions you can get from these tables:

* **Saka** could be outstanding if he can nail his spot (but he could be easily replaced by Lacazette, if Emery decides to play both (Laca and Auba)
* **Cantwells** stats are very good for his price bracket. Had some bad luck the last 3 games. But he gets a lot of pressure from Onel Hernandez, who comes back from injury
* **Traores** performance against city was maybe just a stray bullet...
* **CHO´s** stats are outstanding and slightly better than Mount´s, but the sample size is very bad, so be careful. And Lampard plays with 5 defenders against the tougher teams, so he could be benched. Dark horse, but could be at least as good as Mount if he can nail the spot...
* **Mount** offers still a very good value, could be a must have this season and is on the route to get about 180 points or even more...
* Be careful with **Maddison**, his stats show that he was a bit lucky with his goals so far. But his fixtures where very hard so far and now turning green...
* All of the City-Options are outstanding. Should have scored more goals and show have assisted more goal. **KDB** is simply outstanding. Offers the best value of all players if he can hold his form. Seems that **Mahrez** is now first choice on the right wing, which makes him also very tasty...
* **Salah´s** stats are just slightly better than **Mané´s**...so if you are on wildcard it´s really an option to switch, because of the money you get and the lower ownership of mane. Stats of the past also show that Mané is more clinical than Salah...the egyptian king needs  a lot of chances to score goals...

280,r/FantasyPL,aminboldi,Where to find player performance data from a certain period (GW5-Gw8),"I'm interested in seeing the FPL points scored and minutes played for players between two gameweeks.

Looking at the player ownership percentages I get the feeling that the first four gameweeks had a higher impact in our perception of the player potentials compared to the next four.

This could easily have been reversed, meaning that if the last four gameweeks were played first, instead of Pukki we would see Wesley's price sky rocket and instead of Cantwell it would be Traore as everyone's fifth midfielder.

286,r/FantasyPL,404randomguy404,Kneejerk United - Wildcard Activated!,"Welcome back to the 2019/20 edition of r/FantasyPL's hive mind team! An exercise in which you, the members of this sub, select and maintain an FPL team throughout the course of an entire footballing season.

---

It hasn't been the best of starts for Kneejerk United with the team currently placed at 1,844,028	in the overall rankings after these first 8 game weeks. So in hopes of making a much-required turnaround, the community has decided to play our first chip of the season, the wildcard. 70% of you were in favour for activating the WC in our [last poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dff5hw/kneejerk_united_gw_9_wilcard_vote/), then it clearly must be the best time for the team to change things up and create a much better squad to tackle the upcoming game weeks. As the opportunity to play our 2nd wildcard won't come till GW 20, so thinking about the long term should be an important factor while picking the team.

Let's kick things off nice and easy today. 3 polls for you to complete and then we'll get back to you tomorrow once we've had time to assess the results.

---

**Poll 1 - [Players You Want to Keep](https://www.strawpoll.me/18778817)**

 Please select all players from the current team that you would like to keep on WC. 

**Poll 2 - [Goalkeeper Combination](https://www.strawpoll.me/18778794)**

Vote for your preferred goalkeeper combination in the poll above. For the sake of simplicity, we have created three GK categories - Premium, Fodder and Budget. All possible viable combinations among them are put up into the poll for you to vote on. Please note that keepers like Schmeichel or Patricio who are priced around 5m should also be considered as budget GKs. Any keeper priced above or around 5.5m should be considered a premium GK however.

**Poll 3 - [Formation](https://www.strawpoll.me/18765440)**

Finally, if you would be so kind as to complete the formation poll above it will go a long way to helping us structure our posts for the week. The next time you will have the opportunity to change this will be during the final changes stage of the Wildcard process.

**[Kneejerk United](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/2000323/history)**


Pope (4.6) - Button (4)

VVD (6.5) - Digne (6) - Otamendi (5.5) - Tomori (4.6) - Lundstram (4.2)

Salah (12.5 / **Y**) - Sterling (12.1) - KDB (9.7 / **Y**) - Mount (6.7) - Dendoncker (4.4 / **Y**)

Pukki (7) - King (6.3) - Greenwood (4.4 / **Y**)

I would rather have a cheaper 4th mid like McGinn/Yarmolenko and go utilise that fund on forwards.\n7. Perreira : 6.1m is a bit too much for a leicester defender. If you are chasing league positions , then it makes sense to take a gamble, otherwise i can\\`t see a reason why anyone would risk that much money on Perreira , when you got so many cheaper options and good opportunity to use funds in the forward line.\n\nTo conclude, i would have minimum 2 and a maximum of 4 players from these 2 teams.\n\nTammy, Mount, Soyuncu, Maddison in that order', ""I've got 5 of them.\n\nMaddison, Soyuncu and Tammy, Mount and Tomori. They are just too good value"", 'I already have Mount and will most likely go Pukki &gt; Abraham before the deadline, other than them I can’t afford to get more because there are too many players I don’t want to drop (TAA, Robertson, KDB, Wilson, Sterling, Son at least not before Watford at home).', 'Mount, Abraham, Soy for me feel essential. After that your likely eroding your City or Liverpool positions to follow green fixtures and ignoring Bournemouth.']"

298,r/FantasyPL,julianface,Factoring in Opportunity Cost of Bench Fodder When Making Transfers,"I've been thinking hard about my 2 FTs this week and realized (better late than never) that 2 budget strikers will have an expected pay out better than having 1 striker + Van Dijk. This is mostly inspired by the point predictions on FPLreview which are the best source of expected points predictions I'm aware of. 

Anyways the point is I was mulling over whether Rico+Abraham/Wilson was better than Soyoncu/Tomori+Jimenez/Haller. In isolation it would look like the latter would be the higher points expectation BUT this is ignoring the fact that I have Lundstram and Cantwell as my 1st and 2nd subs which I imagine is also true for lots of others. So once I narrowed down my decision to Soyoncu+Jimenez vs. Rico+Abraham I had to not just consider Soyoncu vs. Rico, it was actually comparing Soyoncu as a set and forget starter vs. the best weekly matchup between Rico/Lundstram/Cantwell. When I properly considered the potential of playing 1 of these 3 fodders every week, Soyoncu was no better and thus a waste of funds. In other words the marginal gain of Abraham over Jimenez outweighs the marginal benefit of Soyoncu over 1 of Lundstram/Rico/Cantwell (which there actually isn't any). 

Something to keep in mind when you're planning your transfers. We have several startable bench fodder options this year which makes transfer planning a little less straightforward.",self.FantasyPL,,1570845832.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dgiv5b/factoring_in_opportunity_cost_of_bench_fodder/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dgiv5b/factoring_in_opportunity_cost_of_bench_fodder/,6,19,19,"['Yes. I personally use fplreview.com to visualize fixtures across my team and plan for these scenarios', 'My bench consists of four possible players, Lundstram, Cantwell, Kelly, Greenwood. One of them(usually one of the first two) starts every week. \n\nI am between two options, downgrade Son and upgrade Greenwood or downgrade Son and upgrade Pukki. First option means i will have 3 starting strikers but will always need to bench Cantwell(or choose other mid/for, all of them 6.5 mil and above), second option means i sacrifice Pukki for one of Vardy/Wilson. \n\nI will go for second option(after GW9)  because my joy of all my three starting strikers return in a single week will not be so much once i leave 8 points on bench from Cantwell and 14 points from Lundstram..\n\nOf course, Lundstram and Kelly have difficult fixtures from now on but there will still be weeks when bench points will be high if i follow the first option.\n\nTL;DR I agree that, this year, we have a lot of good cheap bench options which are worth of starting from time to time. Going for a system which is restricting these options on the bench most of the times(e.g. three 6.0+ strikers plus Cantwell as 5th mid) will result to a high amount of lost bench points. This is not optimal.', 'Personally i hate it having so many bench fodders. I usually pick the wrong one to start and i bench 6 pts most weeks...', 'Nice write up', 'Except this falls over if your team picks up an injury or red card.']"
