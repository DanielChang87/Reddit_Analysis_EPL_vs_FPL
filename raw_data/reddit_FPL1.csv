0,r/FantasyPL,DoTheRax,Average of GW 9 is higher than the average of GW 8.,"Can someone please explain to me how this gw's average is higher than the previous gw? Despite highly owned players like Mane and Abraham exploding. Also despite returns from Burnley defenders, Mount, Lundstram, a cheeky TAA bonus in the previous gameweek, we have a higher gw average this week with literally no one who is significantly owned returning/exploding except a 5, 6, and 8 from Sterling, Lundstram and Robbo. I really don't understand the maths behind this.",self.FantasyPL,,1571732313.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dl9liy/average_of_gw_9_is_higher_than_the_average_of_gw_8/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dl9liy/average_of_gw_9_is_higher_than_the_average_of_gw_8/,10,2,2,"['The difference is only one point though, both weekends weren’t great.', 'Aguero and salah owners got screwed over.

1,r/FantasyPL,QuickyGaming,Lundstram would have scored points 34 if he was correctly categorized as a midfielder.,"These calculations will be really long, there's no real purpose in it other than to be a filler so this post doesn't get removed. Also the bonus points might have been different but I'm not sure how to calculate them.

Note: Lundstram is currently on 45 points in his current, miscategorized state.

GW 1: BOU (A) - 2 points for playing 77 minutes, 1 bonus point = 3 points

GW 2: CRY (H) - 2 points for playing 90 minutes, 5 points for 1 goal scored, 1 point for a clean sheet, -1 point for a yellow card, 3 bonus points = 10 points

GW 3: LEI (H) - 2 points for playing 90 minutes, -1 point for a yellow card = 1 point

GW 4: CHE (A) - 2 points for playing 90 minutes = 2 points

GW 5: SOU (H) - 2 points for playing 77 minutes = 2 points

GW 6: EVE (A) - 2 points for playing 90 minutes, 3 points for 1 assist, 1 point for a clean sheet, 3 bonus points = 9 points

GW 7: LIV (H) - 2 points for playing 90 minutes = 2 points

GW 8: WAT (A) - 2 points for playing 90 minutes, 1 point for a clean sheet, -1 point for a yellow card = 2 points

GW 9: ARS (H) - 2 points for playing 90 minutes, 1 point for a clean sheet = 3 points

3 + 10 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 9 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 34 points.

34 points would still make him one of the best midfield bench fodders available.

15,r/FantasyPL,chapalang,"Salah, De Bruyne , Mane and Sterling","Which 2 of the 4 would you guys pick and why?

Salah being the last 2 seasons points leader and being on pens seems to make him a must have over the others but recently hit a rough patch and has many transferring him out. However going without him makes you prone to missing out on massive hauls.

Mane seems to be similar to Salah but at a lower price point might seem more value.

De Bruyne definitely the most popular option this season, current points leader and looking like an absolute essential in City’s side. Although he didn’t return this week he still influential and was unlucky not to return despite coming off an injury.

Sterling similar to Salah, second biggest goal threat for the best side in the Premier League (up for debate), Prone to rotation though although less so then Aguero.",self.FantasyPL,Discussion,1571692557.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dl0eb6/salah_de_bruyne_mane_and_sterling/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dl0eb6/salah_de_bruyne_mane_and_sterling/,81,40,40,"[""Currently sitting on Mane, De Bruyne.

23,r/FantasyPL,aurorabortrealis,Brief discussion of Solskjaer's 3412 vs Liverpool.,"Posting this to hear people's thoughts on the Utd v Liverpool game.

I'll start by saying that any discussion may be for nought, as I'm not expecting this to become United's default formation going forward.

Solskjaer's main reason for going with 3 centre backs was so they could directly match up with Liverpool's front 3. I believe this would have been the case regardless of whether Salah played or not. 

The wingbacks (AWB and Young) were instructed to press TAA and Robertson in the attacking half, then drop in to form a back 5 in the defending half. Mctominay and Fred were fairly defensive, with their main role being to track the late runs of Wijnaldum and Henderson, and to screen the defence when dropping into 5ATB.

The front 3 didn't press too aggressively. Pereira's primary goal was to block the pass to Fabinho, in an attempt to force Liverpool to play long. In attack, they rotated well and looked to get in behind the full backs before squaring the ball, as we saw for the goal.

The strenght of the formation was the ability to man mark all over the pitch. Origi in particular struggled to find space, while Mane had a little more joy against Rojo.

The weakness of the formation was offensively. Van Dijk and Matip didn't have too many issues with Rashford and James, who had to chase a lot of balls in behind for little reward. The inability of 2/3 of the centre backs to play out from the back hindered United's attack.

AWB and Young didn't have many opportunities to get into crossing positions. Young's crossing was predictably poor. AWB seemed to hesitate before crossing a few times, which meant they were blocked. As his decision making gets better I would expect him to improve here.

As expected, Rashford and James had most of their success on the counter attack, but struggled against a set defence. From an FPL standpoint, I still worry about United's ability to score against teams who set up defensively and look to counter.

Liverpool really struggled to break down the defence, having to resort to a lot of long balls and deep crosses. Personally I was pretty disappointed that TAA wasn't more aggressive, while Robertson had a lot more success, despite going against the stronger defender. Origi spent most of his time camped on the wing, while Mane was looking to roam and get on the ball, similar to how Salah plays when healthy, but with limited success. 

Conclusion: this wall of text may be for nothing, as I don't really expect United to persist with 3 centre backs. But I thought it was interesting how it was very effective at shutting down Liverpool's attack. Remember how much Liverpool struggled against Sheffield United's back 3.

I think it's clear that Rashford needs to play either on the left or with a strike partner, and not alone up top. This formation gives him that partner, and, to a degree, the opportunity to cut in from the left and not leave the penalty box a vacuum, since he and James seemed to split towards the wings every chance they got.\n\nThings will look different, and hopefully better, with Pogba, Shaw, and Martial back to full fitness, mind. I'm curious to see how we'd function if we went with a 3-4-1-2 or a 3-4-3 more often in games. Lindelof, Maguire and Tuanzebe as the three, McT and Pogba in the middle, Shaw and AWB as the WBs, and James/Rash/Martial upfront. It's not a bad template honestly and can't be worse than we've been doing with the 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 or whatever the fuck it is we had before this.\n\nAnd the best part of it all is...

Really good analysis and food for thought.

TAA was especially frustrating trying to play long balls to Mane and Origi from deep in their own half. Everything was cut out by United’s 3 CBs. United did great to pressure early, and what Liverpool really needed to do was control the possession and try not to let the Old Trafford crowd get in their head. Instead, AWB absolutely shut down Robertson on the wing and United broke down the right two or three times with really dangerous looking attacks. Mostly by releasing James in behind Robertson.\n\nUnited seemed to tire out a lot in he second half but Liverpool could not string three passes along despite having 60+% possession. Firmino had no joy without Salah Liverpool’s only real goal threat was Mane, who was utterly neutralized except for the VAR episode. \n\nReally, the only way United we’re going to score in that game was on the counter and Liverpool played into it. The goal came from Robertson overrunning Origi and then Origi losing the ball very cheaply. \n\nI think teams have pretty much figured out Liverpool are vulnerable on the counter attack, but I can’t help but think that if Salah was fit, the game would have gone very differently.']"

Apologies if this has been answered before or if there’s a really easy way to find out and I’m just being lazy...

However, depending on circumstances, even if a player's price drops, the price one is able to sell that player at may not change.

Example. I bought Pukki for 6.8m, if was price was initially 7.1m, I could sell him for 6.9m. If his price drops to 7.0m, I can still sell for 6.9m. So when his price dropped from 7.1m to 7m I didn't need to make a quickfire decision to sell before the drop.

Edit: it's based on the premise that for evry 0.2m rise above the price paid, the selling price increases by 0.1m

48,r/FantasyPL,gongersio,Agüero?,"Seems like he isn't nailed and there might be better options like Auba. Or is it worth keeping faith in him because City score so many goals? Is Sterling potentially a better option? I've had him 3 weeks and he's been benched twice(and blanked once). I don't really know what to do with him so I wanted to hear what other people are going to do with him.






Filler:
Agüero moved to Premier League club Manchester City in July 2011 for an undisclosed fee thought to be in the region of £35 million. On the last day of his debut season with the club, he scored a 94th-minute winner against Queens Park Rangers that earned City its first league title in 44 years. At the end of the 2015–16 season, of players who had played at least two seasons in the Premier League, Agüero had the highest goals per minute ratio in the history of the competition since its formation in 1992, averaging a goal every 106 minutes, ahead of Thierry Henry.[6] He also holds the joint-record for the most goals scored in a single Premier League match – five – and the fastest to do so, in 23 minutes and 34 seconds of match time.[7] In November 2017, Agüero became Manchester City's all-time highest goal-scorer, scoring his 178th City goal against Napoli.[8] Agüero is currently the 6th highest goalscorer in Premier League history, and the highest non-European scorer in the history of the Premier League, with 170 goals in the division.

Often considered to be one of the best strikers in the world,[229] Agüero is regarded as an all-out centre forward,[230] but can also play as a second striker off another striker, which he often did at Atlético Madrid with Diego Forlán,[231] due to his passing ability, tactical intelligence, and vision, which made him a capable assist-man.[232] When asked to name the players who influenced his playing style, Agüero named former Brazilian striker Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Ronaldinho and Diego Maradona as the best players to have played the game, but said that the player who influenced his style of play the most was “the Brazilian Ronaldo”.",self.FantasyPL,Discussion,1571589108.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dkgyzb/agüero/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dkgyzb/agüero/,16,0,0,"['Pep barely ever drops aguero for home games .

49,r/FantasyPL,SebastianOwenR1,Some interesting differential picks have begun to arise.,"This is especially important for those of us looking to escape some collapsing players. Teemu Pukki for instance. 

There has been huge buzz recently around Callum Hudson-Odoi. The youngster has returned from injury, and since that return has been crucial to Chelsea’s attack, scoring once and assisting 3 times in 4 appearances (1 league cup), and could be moving into good form.

Along the lines of a Pukki replacement, you may look at premium choices like Vardy, Wilson, and Jimenez, but performing just as well recently is former Liverpool striker Danny Ings (5.9 mil), who has scored 6 and an assist across all competitions for Southampton, and earlier on in the season put one in the net against his former team (albeit off of a mindless fault from Adrian.) His fixtures are scary but will be looking up in a few weeks, and he’s proven he can score against the odds. 

A midfield option who appears to be taking the spotlight from the beloved John McGinn is his teammate Jack Grealish. Fixtures also remove some of the palatability of this option. The man has clocked 4 goals and 4 assists in competition this season. He appears to be benefiting off of a tactical change at Villa, and is playing strong, promising football. 

Another option is the steady, reliable Youri Tielemans. He proved once again yesterday that he isn’t just good for assists, and he has amazing fixtures in the future, and benefits from in form teammates. 

I know I mentioned Jimenez as a premium option earlier, but then you realize that despite starting with a 35% ownership at the start of the season, Raul Jimenez has dropped below 10%. And then immediately struck form. He scored in the Europa League match before the IB, and assisted 2 against city in Wolves’ win, before scoring the drawing penalty yesterday. His form is starting to look up, and we know that the man has points in him, evidenced by last year. 

Tomori returned some today, as did Wood, and both may be mentionable, but I’ll wait for another week. These are just some interesting inclusions i thought I’d bring up. Good luck to all, and may the point drought begone.

TL;DR: Ings, CHO, Grealish, Jimenez (yes technically a differential), Tielemans. They doing neat things. Look at em.",self.FantasyPL,Discussion,1571587224.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/dkgq9b/some_interesting_differential_picks_have_begun_to/,/r/FantasyPL/comments/dkgq9b/some_interesting_differential_picks_have_begun_to/,44,89,89,"[""Dear lord don't waggle the glass man Ings in front of me......fine player and ability but a brisk winter breeze might injure him as soon as I transfer him in."", 'Mate paragraphs please, this felt like one huge sentence to read', 'I really wish I had waited to do my wildcard.', 'Guilbert has also been under the radar recently. Good player.', 'They change like the wind , more concerning is Mounts minutes and Kovacic fine 2nd half performance', 'Having checked the number of points left on my bench over the past months, I can confirm that Ings gets points and also that he typically gets them against the odds.', ""Like the Jimenez pick, especially as everyone seems to be jumping on Wilson and Vardy. Think he might sneak under the radar. Big question mark is Europa League. but Wolves seem to have found a way to cope with it recently. \n\nWas in interesting reminder of Alonso's capability yesterday, only 3.5% owned and with great fixtures could be one to add to the list - but at a price. If Harvey Barnes manages to nail down a place he'd be straight into my team. Three assists and 16 points in his last three games despite only managing 180 of the 270 minutes. Would put him at eight points per 90 minutes, but even 50% of that would be great value for 5.9 and only 0.3% ownership..... But sadly he'll never nail that place."", '* I wish i had bought CHO instead of Maddison...Maddison looked not too bad and yes he´s maybe a bit more nailed on, but CHO was simply amazing.

**In Summary**

We’ve seen the effects of injuries, Champions League, Carabao Cup ties, bad performances and the international break on Pep’s thinking on this and while there may be no strong correlation there is an interesting pattern. 

- Laporte (6.3) went out vs Brighton, Pep had to adjust and forced KDB to play in a deeper role while Fernandinho would be shifted to CB as what happened vs Watford

- Playing in other competitions doesn’t always correlate into being benched in the Premier League but it did for Sterling vs Watford. He played every league game and at Shakhtar as well as for England which meant Guardiola rested him.

If there’s any pattern you notice, please respond. It took me a while after watching the Crystal Palace game to find the statistics.

70,r/FantasyPL,mikecro2,Picks and transfers the veteran managers made this week compared to sample of top 500k (GW9),"Regular feature to compare the picks of  2519  FPL veterans against a sample of about 10k teams from the top 500k. Any team in my sample of top 500k which hasn't made a transfer in last 3 weeks gets excluded.

Determination of who is a veteran manager at:  https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/cqn30q/refining_the_veteran_analysis_aka_what_is_the/ 

The  2519  veterans made  4984 transfers this GW.  268 ( 10.6 %) played their wild card.
( 67.3 % have now already played WC)

For the picks comparison, I have filtered out the low ownership (but high ratio &gt; 1.2) players (threshold is 2%). If you don't see a player below then it will be because there is not enough ownership or the ratio is not big enough.

Raw picks data saved on Google Sheets as:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pyZgfphwSCRcdFmfZtGsZvpkFDLdzMK73yLMJMBuJeQ/edit?usp=sharing

1) There have been far less clean sheets


2) More breakthroughs among less costly players


3) Large inconsistency in performance among premium players. Last year's captaincy options were of a much lesser headaches as the top tier players would return at least once in every 2 games or so. I recalled Sterling and Salah didn't find the net for 6 games or so but they provided assists


4) City's rotation becomes even more drastic


5) Player's prices are as volatile as the stock market


6) I couldn't recall a GW in 18/19 like the one we had in GW8
