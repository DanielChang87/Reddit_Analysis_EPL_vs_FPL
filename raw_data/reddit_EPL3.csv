United's success just since 1990 would see them place joint-28th on the most successful clubs table when every other club uses their total trophy haul from their entire histories!

Now, contexualizing their success further and in the grander scheme of all professional sports, I've recently noticed that u/SportsFan591 has been compiling stats on successful teams in different sports. So, having got his/her permission to share their data, you can use the tables to compare United's recent success to all other sports clubs, starting with:

**AMERICAN FOOTBALL -** [https://www.reddit.com/r/FootballAmerica/comments/dfbvnp/nfl\_teams\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FootballAmerica/comments/dfbvnp/nfl_teams_with_the_most_trophies/)

* As you can see, United's success from 1990 onwards comfortably eclipses every American Football teams' historical success. The closest in numbers to United's 43 trophies from this period are the Green Bay Packers with 22 honours.

**CRICKET** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/czi629/domestic\_cricket\_clubs\_with\_the\_most\_trophies\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/czi629/domestic_cricket_clubs_with_the_most_trophies_in/)

* United 1990-2019 beats all but three Cricket clubs in trophies won, with two of those three clubs ahead by only two and six trophies respectively.

**HOCKEY** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/dit8a8/hockey\_teams\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/dit8a8/hockey_teams_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United 1990-2019 would already be the 3rd most decorated hockey club ever, although they'd be some way behind the top two!

**RUGBY UNION** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyunion/comments/dd469a/rugby\_union\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyunion/comments/dd469a/rugby_union_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most/)

* United 1990-2019 would once again be the 3rd (joint 3rd this time) most decorated rugby union club in history, although just like with hockey clubs, they'd be some way off the top two.

**RUGBY LEAGUE** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyleague/comments/dad3a7/rugby\_league\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyleague/comments/dad3a7/rugby_league_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most/)

* United 1990-2019 would see them finish 6th on the list of the most decorated rugby league clubs in history, and just one trophy away from breaking into the top 5!

**BASEBALL** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/d3btcg/baseball\_teams\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/d3btcg/baseball_teams_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United 1990-2019 would finish 4th on a list of the most decorated baseball clubs ever, almost 10 trophies above what's needed to crack the top 5!

**HANDBALL** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Handball/comments/cyrfp1/handball\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Handball/comments/cyrfp1/handball_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United 1990-2019 would finish 10th on a list of the most decorated handball clubs ever, a feat all the more impressive considering that handball is one of the oldest sports historically, with some leagues going back to the beginning of the 20th century.

**AUSSIE RULES** \-  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/d1nn3j/australian\_football\_teams\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/d1nn3j/australian_football_teams_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United 1990-2019 come 3rd on a list of the most successful Aussie Rules teams ever, just five trophies shy of second placed Norwood.

**BANDY** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bandy/comments/d0ow2m/bandy\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bandy/comments/d0ow2m/bandy_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United 1990-2019 would finish 2nd on a list of the most decorated bandy clubs in history, and over 20 trophies ahead of what would be needed to break the top 5.

**PESAPALLO** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Pesapallo/comments/d0lgib/pesapallo\_teams\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pesapallo/comments/d0lgib/pesapallo_teams_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United would comfortably finish ahead of every pesapallo team historically, and by over 25 trophies from the next most successful club.

**WATER POLO** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/waterpolo/comments/cyuof1/water\_polo\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/waterpolo/comments/cyuof1/water_polo_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most/)

* United's lowest ranking position would come amongst water polo clubs, but they'd still manage a top 15 place finish in 14th spot.

United's success in the last 30 years alone would thus already place them in the top 10 of the most decorated clubs ever lists for all but two sports (football itself, where they'd be 28th, and water polo, where they'd be 14th) and the top 5 of all but four sports (football, water polo, handball where they'd be 10th and rugby league where they'd be 6th).

They seem to have decided to never overturn a foul call/no-call and to never use the pitchside monitors.\n\nI actually agree that the monitors shouldn\'t be there.  If you watch MLS the way VAR is implemented, you\'ll see up to 2 minutes burned for the VAR to have a look to tell the CR to wander over to the monitors to make a really clear call in order to sell it all to the fans.  And the fans here in the US really do expect that kind of ceremony.  If there\'s a close call which is correct fans will scream in the post-match thread ""why wasn\'t VAR even used, surely they have to take a look at that"" simply because of butthurt.\n\nBut the PLs interpretation of ""clear an obvious error"" means that since foul calls are subjective, they consider none of those calls to be clear and obvious.  They should drop that bar down so that its just obvious to the neutral that the call should be overturned.  No call will ever be 100%, but if you get it to 90/10 opinion that the call on the field was wrong then it should be overturned.\n\nBut those should be clear enough that the VAR ref can make the call in the booth and the CR pretty much never needs to take a look at the monitors.  I do think the monitors need to go away.  But the PL refs need to sort out the conditions under which they\'ll actually have VAR overturn a foul call on the field.\n\nSo as an MLS viewer I\'ll just say that you don\'t actually want VAR exactly the same way as its used in the rest of the world, and that I can see where the PL is trying to avoid some of the worst bits of VAR.  But it does seem like they\'ve run so far the other direction as to turn it into a joke where its just never used.', 'VAR is fine, but it\'s implementation into the Prem has been a joke. \n\nWhat\'s a clear and obvious mistake? After the Spurs match, I haven\'t a fucking clue. \n\nAnd then the match today, how United didn\'t leave with 3-4 yellow cards I don\'t have any idea. \n\nThere is absolutely no consistency in refereeing. As Charlie Austin so appropriately put it: ""It\'s a joke"".', 'United love it, Liverpool hate it', 'I like it, but the people using it need to up their game.', ""Goal, offside, handball, red cards, penalty claims.  In those instances the VAR official should be God.  No on field decision in those instances should stand, one way or another, without the approval of the VAR official.  It is literally that simple, EPL just needs to stomp out the ego of their officials and make them understand it's not about them, it's about the football teams playing.\n\nRegarding United-Liverpool game, VAR made the right decision to disallow Mane's goal.  New rule states that any contact of the ball via hand is to be called a handball.  There was contact, case closed.  But the Origi one is trickier, which is where the point of this post comes into play.  Criteria.\n\nThe tackle directly lead to a goal and therefore applies in the five instances in which VAR should have the final say.  The criteria Atkinson had during the first half allowed for a more physical game and in that context you could argue that the tackle was on the same level as most, therefore no foul.  If he decided that Origi didn't have control of the ball (the Lukaku touch) when the tackle was made, you could once again argue that there was no foul.  But here's the problem:\n\nOrigi's first touch was poor but he was still on his feet and headed toward the ball.  In other words, he was still in play when the contact on his shin brought him down and United claimed possession.  The play results with United breaking and scoring.  Since that falls in the five instances laid out above, VAR official should be completely removed from the criteria of the on field referee and simply determine if any rule of the game was broken in the goal scoring situation.\n\nCriteria is the issue here.  On field ref can have his, VAR official can have his.  Which takes precedent?  I feel like the ego of EPL refs makes the arbiter on the pitch the king of the hill and they clearly don't like that being taken away.  But if the point of the system is fair arbitration following the rule book, then their ego should be stomped right here, right now.\n\nGoal, offside, handball, red cards, penalty claims.  In these five instances the VAR has the final word, period.  That didn't happen this weekend, especially tonight."", ""We've been hard done by too many times the last seasons for me not to love VAR. Bloody brilliant!"", 'Origi flopped and VAR only helped confirm the flop', ""Feel like there should be a pitch side monitor for the referee. And he should be only referred there for dubious decisions that those in the VAR center (or whatever they call it) don't deem clear and obvious.""]"

36,r/PremierLeague,NotaNoobPat,The Premier League are Hanging Fans Out to Dry and I Don't Feel Enough People Know About It,"I just want to say that I am very appreciative for the amount of Premier League Football I can easily view on TV every weekend. Accessibility to watch football in the UK and abroad is at an all time high. However, it is important to note that individual clubs and the Premier League alike have benefited greatly from this (Monetarily). However, the Premier League are currently screwing fans and I don’t feel like enough people are paying attention.


For those who aren’t familiar, the Premier League releases a fixture list of all the games that will be played during the season but they do not release the times for those matches. They are all listed at 9AM for weekends and 1:45PM for weekday games (American CST). This is only done so TV networks like SkySports, NBC, or Amazon can pick which games they want in prime time to get the highest rating and maximize profits. Typically, the Premier League releases the schedule on time (Friday Release) or on the following Monday at the latest. This time, the schedule for Dec/Jan is nearly a week late (https://www.premierleague.com/news/1242110). It was scheduled to be released on October 11th and there has been no word from the PL about when it will be released. This is apparently due to Amazon Prime gaining the ability to stream some amount of special games in December.


The December and early January schedule are particularly important as there is an influx of domestic and international travel to see clubs. With typical winter breaks, domestic fans are able to arrange travel plans to see their team on Boxing Day (Day after Christmas) where every team plays. For international fans of the Premier League, this is one of the only times they can be guaranteed to see 2 games in 3-4 days in a time that is commonly taken as vacation. This is especially true for Americans who typically receive Christmas Eve (Dec. 24) to the day after New Years (Jan. 2).


With every day that passes, plane, train, and coach tickets becoming increasingly more expensive since demand increases during peak holiday travel. Furthermore, clubs are putting tickets on sale for events that don’t have confirmed dates/times yet. Tottenham has already sold tickets for their highly anticipated match with Chelsea slated for Dec. 21st. Watford will put their tickets up for their match against Man Utd soon if not already. Everton vs. Arsenal tickets is also the same weekend. The following weekend, Arsenal are at home against Chelsea. It is virtually impossible to cheaply plan to see your clubs when you don’t know the days and times. Even worse, people may feel pressure to buy tickets to see a game because they know it will sell out and will just have to pray that the date/time isn’t moved to a spot that they cannot attend.


Fans who are trying to see their clubs are currently being left out to rot and the Premier League has had 0 accountability and given no firm date that the schedule will be confirmed. This is quite frankly unacceptable from what is supposed to be the greatest football league on earth. The schedule needs to be released immediately so fans can adequately plan travel.",self.PremierLeague,Discussion,1571349761.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/dj6toj/the_premier_league_are_hanging_fans_out_to_dry/,/r/PremierLeague/comments/dj6toj/the_premier_league_are_hanging_fans_out_to_dry/,47,165,165,"[""The UK fans always have priority.

Premier league schedule is released before the season starts and like any professional sporting league, fixtures are subject to change.\n\nWe have two domestic cup completions and two European completions that our clubs are involved in. As teams progress through these additional completions the premier league fixtures change with them. It is very rare for games to be moved on short notice and even more unbelievable is the time of KO being moved at short notice. Yes Sky and BT can request for KO times to be moved but this is done weeks if not months in advance. For those of us that travel home and away it has NEVER been an issue. \n\nBefore moaning about a subject you clearly have very little experience in, take a look at LaLiga in Spain. KO times can change on the day of fixture and moan about that.', ""The Christmas fixtures benefit foreigners more than it does domestic fans.\n\nIf you're travelling from abroad to watch Premier league football then from the saturday before Christmas until the 2nd of January each team plays 4 times, you're terrible at planning of you can't attend one of these and if you were coming for football surely you'd stay in London/Manchester/Liverpool since generally speaking these are the most followed teams by foreigners.\n\nWhat it actually fucks up is domestic fans travel plans, rebooking train tickets, having to take days off work, just changing it to studidly inconvinient times that makes it impossible - especially for the away fans.\n\nFuck sky sports, every game should be 3pm Saturday."", 'I’m sympathetic, especially because I’d like to travel to the UK to see my team at least once in my life.  It won’t be a cheap trip and it won’t be anytime soon, so I can only hope things improve for both fans of local teams and larger premier league teams.\n\nSpeaking to the larger issue is the problem of money.  The EPL knows there are dollars to tap into overseas, whether it’s the USA or China or anywhere else.  I can only hope that the league listens to fans and supporters that built the league, i.e. the lifelong fans that attend games each week.  I don’t want to see the league chase money like the NFL and NBA have done in recent years.  After what Bury went through and with the large influx of ‘money laundering’ through team purchases, I hope it spurs more activism to keep things going as they were.  That local love of teams is what drew me to the EPL and it’s what, I suspect, us foreigners find so appealing about it.\n\nIt’s going to be down to all of us consumers to protect the aspects that we value in the league and some of us will miss out on certain things because of it.  If the integrity is lost, I think people will move on to something else if they aren’t listened to.', ""Unfortunately it's a business.

He's tried to fob this off as an injury crisis, but look, this is Manchester fucking Utd... we should have enough players to compete at least, even if there's injuries. Man Shitty are basically missing most of their defense and yet look at them; they've opted for the 'you score 3, we'll score 4' mentality. But as of now, Man Shitty have scored three times the amount of goals as Utd this season... The irony of Utd having a former *striker* who can't get the team to score. You'd honestly think it should be the other way around, that they could score and not defend, and us Utd fans would fucking take that over what's going on now at any rate. \n\nPoch: Not a chance. Levy knows he won't find better in the short term. Also won't pay for it.\n\nBruce: That win over Manure gives a lot of goodwill that'll last up to xmas.\n\nHassenhitler: Not been a good season, but look at the garbage he's working with ffs. Also, remember when he took over last year; he had a lot of work to do after the balls-up Hughes made. Compare this current Saints team to the 2015-16 squad of Pellè, Mane, Tadic, VvD, Wanyama, Fonte, etc. Fuck me, if Hassenhitler has that squad, he'd get in the top 4 now.\n\nFlores: Quite likely. His team's been pish this season. 0 wins, 4 goals scored and 20 conceded in 8 games?!?!?! It's a very weak squad, though. Take out Deeney and Deulofeu and you basically have a poor Championship squad there.\n\nHodgson: Doubt it; he has previous for digging his teams out of a hole. Plus has a lot of goodwill with the supporters. Needs to get them scoring more, though.\n\nFarke: Not a chance. Beating Man Shitty bought serious kudos.\n\nEmery: Doubtful. Arsenal like to keep their garbage close.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy bet: Flores. 2 more bad results and he's gone. Traditionally, 40 points is the token amount to keep you up; Watford have 3 points from 8 games (0.375 PPG); they now have 30 more games to increase this to 1.2333 (recurring) to reach 40 points. That's a big ask and Flores ain't gonna do it. He's gone by November."", 'silva 100%', 'I’m in', ""I feel like it's definitely between Silva and Hasenhuttl.

85,r/PremierLeague,endlessSSSS1,Why Some Big Teams (Ahem ... Man U &amp; Spurs) Get Into Trouble Like This ... 12 Theories!!!,"Thinking through why Man U and Tottenham are having such difficulties so far and here are my early conclusions ...

1. The higher up the table you go, the more chance you are tied into lots of competitions into later rounds which means your players are run ragged and traveling much more and get less recovery time and more injuries AND
2. More of your players are really solid players and therefore are chosen for their national teams and go on international duty so they are not only playing more club team games, but also international games which is tiring with travel and game time and jet lag AND
3. That means the players are sometimes having to learn two different styles of play (club team vs national team) which can be confusing and lead to many errors AND
4. Gaffer is basically forced to play certain players because the club team has invested a king’s ransom in bringing them over ... you actually have less flexibility than other clubs to experiment AND
5. Expectations are very high with the big clubs which means the directors and media and fans often put pressure on their managers very quickly ... the players are not immune either ... prolonged stress usually doesn’t help make things better AND 
6. The opposition may have already been knocked out of FA Cup, Carabao, and never made Champions League or Europa League, etc. They have much more time to prepare for their game with you! AND
7. This cycle goes on season after season so these star players are playing many many many more games than other players. For example Tottenham played 64 games in total in all competitions in 2018-19 and Fulham just 49... which adds up to 1,395 additional minutes of game time in just one season if the average game is 90+3 minutes (in other words about 30% more than others) AND
8.  That means more key players are getting injured because there is more chance of it happening when you are playing much more and you are simply not recovering!!  (simple deduction there) ... major issue for Man City right now AND 
9. You have less time to prepare for each opponent AND
10. Even though you paid through the nose and got a really good player, there are lots of other very very very good players around too who the other PL teams snapped up AND
11.  Not only is the squad very tired so is the gaffer which means he is definitely not as sharp as usual AND
12. You are a target for every team. What opponent doesn’t get a thrill from knocking off a Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham, etc.  The opposing gaffer gets a lot more credit for beating a big club than for taking three points from Watford right now.",self.PremierLeague,Discussion,1570448575.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/dee4em/why_some_big_teams_ahem_man_u_spurs_get_into/,/r/PremierLeague/comments/dee4em/why_some_big_teams_ahem_man_u_spurs_get_into/,4,7,7,"[""Orrr...\n\nMost of United's players are a bit shit."", '1. You get entered in extra competitions, but that\'s not a barometer of how far you\'ll progress in them. This is more of a scheduling problem than a participation problem.\n2. The importance of a good second 11 then, or squad depth. Also, there\'s no more certainty they\'d pick up an injury on international duty than for their club. Also, some foreign players are entered in multiple tournaments (e.g. Africa Cup of Nations,  Euros, Copa America, Confederations Cup etc.) compared to others. This makes it hard to generalise across.\n3. This is an issue (compare Paul Pogba for France vs Paul Jogba for Utd).\n4. This is certainly not as common as you might think. Look at Pulisic at Chelsea; Fat Frank has played him only 5 times in the league and once in the league cup. Also, some players signed can be cup-tied meaning the manager can\'t play them even if he wanted to (e.g. Aubameyang for Gunners). The days of Abramovich impelling Jose to play Shevchenko are long over. \n5. Expectation is high, but fans are realistic. Only one team can win the league each season. Also, it\'s becoming more pertinent now that it\'s not also the *size* of the club that affects this; it\'s also expectations from good performance the season before. Look at Wolves this season; they did great last year and now the fans want and expect more, and rightly so, though Wolves wouldn\'t be considered a *big* club in the traditional sense. \n6. A rehash of point 1. You\'re also assuming homogeneous efficiencies and staff quality to bigger clubs. Small clubs have their own troubles, too. Case in point, constant depredation by bigger clubs creating a lack of cohesion.\n7. Yes, and this is the price of success. Also see my retort to point 2 vis-a-vis squad depth.\n8. You\'re assuming a linear correlation between playing time and potential for injury. There is a far greater number of variables at play than this. This is one of the reasons why big clubs have statisticians and data scientists running MVAs on players. Furthermore, injuries can also be attributed as much to the players as to the training staff; consider Craig Bellamy\'s issues at Man Shitty. Again, variables. I know you said \'simple deduction\', but....\n9. These are teams you face a minimum of twice a season; these are teams with entire teams of scouts and analysts prepping managers and players; this is also assuming other teams face the same travails as your own regarding injuries, multiple competitions, international duty etc.\n10. Squad size is essentially a constant in every league in the world; you can\'t buy all the players (unless you do retarded shit like Chelsea, which doesn\'t pay off).  FFP is also a factor.\n11. EVERY manager is tired; look at them ffs. There\'s no proportional relationship between games played and managerial fatigue. Most of them if not all pretty much work 6/7 day weeks. \n12. *""The opposing gaffer gets a lot more credit for beating a big club than for taking three points from Watford right now.""* Credit, maybe; but most managers value the points more than the illustriousness of taking a scalp. To beat a big club requires risk and the management of risk; only a shit manager would throw caution to the wind to beat a *top 4* team. I\'m not saying it doesn\'t pay off (e.g. Man Shitty vs Norwich) but this is the exception, not the rule.', ""I agree, managers aren't always the problem at a sudden struggling club, players get selfish and big egos need to be controlled and if some players wont capitulate they need to leave they need to understand that they play for the club for the fans, i mean we've seen this with pogba and mourinho last year, 2 big egos clash and the club ends up 2nd best""]"

* This week alone he has played 270 minutes, the full 90 minutes in Wolves games against Watford and Manchester City along with travelling the 4000 mile round trip mid-week to play a full 90 minutes against Besiktas in the Europa League, Wolves won all three games.

So, I've been keeping my own table for the Premier League this season with a points system that, I think, better rewards teams for giving their all for the full 90+ (and punishes teams for falling apart). I don't know if this is something other people have done before but I figured I'd share.  


&amp;nbsp;


4 points are awarded if the goal differential is +3 or more in favor of the team.  
3 points are awarded if the goal differential is +2.  
2 points are awarded if the goal differential is +1.  
1 point is awarded if the goal differential is even.  
-1 points are awarded if the goal differential is -1.  
-2 points are awarded if the goal differential is -2.  
-3 points are awarded if the goal differential is -3 or worse. 


&amp;nbsp;


If two teams are tied on points:  
If the one team has beaten the other, the winner moves ahead.  
If the two teams have drawn or not played eachother, the team with the fewer negative points awarded moves ahead.  
If the two teams are still tied, a die is rolled for each team and the team that rolls a higher number moves ahead.  


&amp;nbsp;


If multiple teams are tied on points:  
The teams are ranked based on the fewest negative points awarded.   
If this still results in a tie, a die is rolled for each team and the team that rolls a higher number moves ahead.

122,r/PremierLeague,slivergao_19x,Leicester hammer 10-man Newcastle,"&gt;[Highlight: Leicester City 5 - 0 Newcastle United](http://www.review24h.online/premier-league/highlight-leicester-city-5-0-newcastle-united-384.html)

“We’re all going on a European tour” sang the Leicester City fans at the King Power Stadium on Sunday, and they could well be right.

https://i.redd.it/oc8alonp3lp31.jpg

Brendan Rodgers’ side won 5-0 against 10-man Newcastle United as they moved up to third in the Premier League table.

Jamie Vardy scored twice, while Ricardo Pereira and Wilfried Ndidi were also on target as Dennis Praet’s effort later went down as a Paul Dummett own goal.

Issac Hayden was shown a straight red card just before half time to make it a tough outing in an even tougher season for Steve Bruce’s Newcastle.

Leicester have 14 points from seven games, while Newcastle have five points.

**3 things we learned**

**1. Leicester ready for the top six**: Fans of the Foxes were singing about Europe on Sunday and you can see why. Rodgers’ young side have so many attacking options, and even without James Maddison they ripped Newcastle apart. They are balanced, defend well, win the midfield battle and have class on the ball to hurt teams in attack. As long as the majority of their squad stays fit, they will be in the top six all season long. The blend between youth and experience is spot on and Leicester, on paper, have players Arsenal, Chelsea and Man United will want. They could finish above those three aforementioned teams this season with Ndidi and Tielemans the unsung heroes in midfield. Next up: Liverpool away. That will be a true test as to how good this team is.

**2. Newcastle in a whole lot of bother**: Just one win from the first seven games of the season doesn’t tell the whole story. Newcastle have been totally devoid of attacking intent in most of their games (Joelinton and Miguel Almiron struggled again) and Steve Bruce has a huge job on his hands to turn this ship around. Despite talk of a new takeover bid led by Peter Kenyon, optimism levels among Newcastle’s fans are not high for this season. The red card didn’t help them at all, but it didn’t alter the likely outcome of this game. Newcastle will be in a relegation scrap all season long and their brilliant fans will have to suffer once again. Next up: Games against Man United and Chelsea. Ouch.

**3. Vardy is having a party**: Vardy has scored 14 goals in 17 Premier League games under Brendan Rodgers and the veteran striker is leading the line superbly. He sets the tone for this squad and with so many young attackers around him, Vardy looks reborn. Rodgers allows him to operate in areas where he’s at his best and the Englishman, now 32, is key to this European push. If he stays fit and in form, Leicester will finish in the top six. If he is injured or runs out of steam, Leicester’s European dream will be in tatters because Rodgers doesn’t have a direct replacement.

**Man of the Match**: Jamie Vardy – Two goals and a constant menace, Vardy gave the Newcastle defense a torrid time. His runs stretch opposition defenses and his finishing is lethal. He will get plenty of service this season and he is allowed to play his natural game. With five goals in his first seven games of the campaign, Vardy is well on track for another 20-goal season in the PL.

Leicester started well as Harvey Barnes cut in from the left and crossed for Perez but the former Newcastle striker saw his instinctive effort saved by Martin Dubravka.

At the other end Newcastle had a few chances on the break and Issac Hayden’s shot across goal could have been diverted goalwards by Yoshinori Muto but the Japanese striker just couldn’t quite sort his feet out.

The Foxes took the lead via a wonderful solo goal as Pereira started the move and then ran almost 30 yards with the ball before rifling home a low shot.

Moments later Leicester’s full back on the other side of the pitch, Ben Chilwell, surged forward and almost scored as Martin Dubravka smothered his effort.

Right on half time Newcastle were reduced to 10 men as Issac Hayden slid in to win a tackle but caught Dennis Praet high with his follow through, and VAR confirmed Hayden was off.

**\[ VIDEO:** [Premier League Highlights](http://www.review24h.online/premier-league/highlight-leicester-city-5-0-newcastle-united-384.html) **\]** 

At the start of the second half Leicester doubled their lead as a long ball played over the top found Barnes who then played in Vardy to slam home at the near post.

Moments later it was 3-0 as Praet was played in on the right and his cross deflected off Paul Dummett and in.

Vardy popped up in the box but missed his kick, while Pereira almost looped in an effort after fine work from sub Marc Albrighton as Newcastle were run ragged in the closing stages of the game.

A lovely cross from Albrighton found Vardy to head home his second and Leiceser’s fourth as the final minutes consisted of Leicester keeping the ball and Newcastle sat deep and hoping for the whistle to blow.

Ndidi scored in the 90th minute to rub extra salt in Newcastle’s wounds as the Foxes flexed their top six credentials.",self.PremierLeague,,1569814491.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/dazzcw/leicester_hammer_10man_newcastle/,/r/PremierLeague/comments/dazzcw/leicester_hammer_10man_newcastle/,0,6,6,

I’ve seen a lot of contradicting posts on various subs about VAR. Some people seem to like that the human error in the game is being checked, others seem to believe that it’s part of the game.

I don’t really have a side, but I can say that refs defaulting to VAR for every questionable play would drive me insane if it were to happen. To mitigate this, I was wondering if there would be a way to make VAR more akin to american football challenges.

A manager would have X (I’m thinking 1-2) amount of VAR challenges in a half/match and they would be able to use them at their discretion. Once they use their VAR challenges they can no longer contest calls made by the refs regardless of whether the call was found to be in favor of the challenge or not.

In certain games, if the ball is shot and bounces back from the keeper or the woodwork and an attacking player scores it, the goal may be disallowed because the second player was offside when the first player shot on goal, but sometimes not. Handballs now don’t take into account the fact that the player touched it intentionally or not, or changed the direction of the ball or not, but there are still referees who will (or not) whistle when the player didn’t even see the ball, or if the attacking player deliberately aims for the defender’s arm.

It works. No one is screaming their heads off in those sports. \n\nIn an attempt to make the game accurate, they have made a mockery of what the game means to the fans. \n\nAdditionally, I have frequently seen the argument for informing the crowd in the stadium about what the VAR referee is seeing. I like the idea. But if the system can be trusted, we do not necessarily need it. Going back to the two sports I mentioned before: in tennis, the trajectory of the ball is shown on the screen. The decision then is pretty unambiguous. In cricket, they DRS is not played on screen (at least in the implementations I have seen). But I wholeheartedly trust the 3rd Umpire to make the right call 99.9% of the time (I give the 0.1% coz of the “too-close-to-call” decisions). In the premier league, this hasn’t been achieved yet. And till the time, us, fans cannot trust the system, I don’t care how right you are, I want to see what the VAR saw. \n\nTL;DR: The referees on the pitch need to grow a pair or just not be on the pitch. Seeing what the VAR sees will surely benefit the fans when the trust in the system isn’t there.', 'Get rid of var', ""I thought about that....but then you're limiting the effectiveness of VAR.

They should have find a quality CAM ( dybala wanted to leave juve, or try to get ericksen from Tottenham) and Winger (maybe should have made a bid for sancho from bvb) but they didn’t. They play an 18 years old from Swansea city which doesn’t really bring anything new to the game.  There’s too many flaws in their squad.

161,r/PremierLeague,Mr_Sam_Alex,We need to talk about VAR...,"Again, gameweek 6 is dominated by talks of VAR. I see arguments popping up saying that millimetres offside shouldn't be offside but i feel this is ridiculous! It is frustrating scoring, only for that goal to be chalked off 30 secs later for something you don't even get a replay of but if you were the opposing team and they didn't give it offside you would be equally annoyed. 

Yes, millimetres is a fraction of an advantage but if we don't give the marginal decisions as offside then where do you draw the line? One week someone will be 2mm offside and it won't be given, the next week they'll be 3mm of side and it will be given. Saying that we shouldn't give marginal decisions only increases the margin for error and will likely cause more controversy.

If anything, maybe we need to look at the offside rule in general, the advantage used to be with the attacker but with the introduction of technology this is long gone. The problem being that due to technology like VAR being available to only a small section of the footballing world, the change would have to be suitable for both high and low level tiers.

I've even toyed with the idea of saying that your only offside if ALL of your body is past the last defender, this would give a massive advantage to strikers but would certainly create more goals.

The fans in the ground don't normally have any idea what is going on, most Premier League grounds don't have big enough screens and it isn't announced over the tannoy or if it is you can barely hear it, it just changes the atmosphere and momentum of the game\n3.

No 'clear and obvious error' or 3mm benefit of doubt. If they can say for sure that a player is offside, then they are offside. If the tech isn't there then don't try and use it. \n\nFor subjective decisions, I think there are 2 options. \n1. No VAR at all for them and leave it to the on field officials.\n2. VAR gets final say but there is a time limit on how long they can take to make a decision (45 seconds or so)\n\nI don't think you can bring 'clear and obvious' into it or give final decision to the ref when VAR has looked at it. VAR have the ability to make a much more informed and certain decision so they should be allowed to use it"", ""Bottom line is this. Do you feel happy when the other team score? No. Do you feel happy when your team scores? Yes. Same thing can be said for Var. Right now I feel like VAR has benefitted the game. At a professional level I'm surprised it hasn't come in sooner to be completely honest. I am one of those people who think offside is offside. Var gets it right everytime. I don't think that's a bad thing and the referees discretion still plays a vital part in the decision making"", ""I think where most people are having a hard time with the millimetres offside bit is that those millimetres weren't calculated by some sort of crazy 3D positioning system with millimetre accuracy but instead are part of a system that involves someone drawing lines on a picture. \n\nSomeone else may well have drawn the lines slightly differently, or even used a different frame on which to draw the lines. That could have resulted in the player being onside, or maybe even more offside.\n\nSo really I think some people are saying the technology isn't accurate enough to give a correct measurement within some range (margin of error), so if the result of VAR is within that range you can't rely on it and should probably go with the initial call.\n\nAs a spurs fan the called sucked of course, but it wasn't the reason we lost that match. After it was overturned it was still 1-0, we just couldn't close out the game (again...)\n\nEdit: I just realized after posting this message that my example was more an example of the system being imprecise rather than inaccurate at a small scale, though really it seems to be both.""]"

The implementation of it, is.","Var is a system that was brought into the league to correct blatant mistakes or missed calls by referees which in theory is a good thing. What the league is doing with it is ruining the game. Counting millimeters to determine whether or not the attacker is offside is absolutely absurd. This is obviously a reaction to Aurier’s disallowed goal against Leicester today. In the early first half there was a goal disallowed scored by Ayoze Perez who was obviously offside when the initial shot was taken, and in my opinion was the right call and the correct way var should be used. In the early second half Son was called offside after var determined that his shoulder was millimeters in front of the defender’s. Aurier’s goal would have taken Tottenham up 2-0 and seemingly winning them the game. Instead the goal was disallowed and Leicester, who played great today and it’s shame that var is talking point of the game, has all of the momentum and go on to win the game. The technology that the Premier League is using is not even advanced enough to determine where Son’s shoulder precisely is. They way they decide the player’s shoulder is by dragging a line to where they think it is and thinking “hey that’s close enough” but if they want to begin to count in precision the millimeters to determine whether or not a player is onside then they should have the proper technology that can precisely determine where the attacker’s shoulder is. Without that sort of technology it leaves these very very close calls to human error, and var was implemented to negate human error not open another door for it.

RB- Trent Alexander Arnold- The full back had a good game against Burnley with 2 tackles, 3 blocks, 5 recoveries and 3 key passes as some of his standout stats. His attempted cross took a deflection of Chris Wood and went in which helped Liverpool win 3-0.

CB- Jannik Vestegaard- The Saints weren't the favourites coming into this match, but Jannik had a great defensive performance with 5 interceptions, 4 clearances and made it difficult for United to get good chances. He earned the Saints a point with a towering header over Lindelof for his first goal in English football

CB- Virgil Van Dijk- It was a great week for Virgil. He won the UEFA Defender of the year and more importantly the UEFA player of the year over Messi and Ronaldo and becoming the first defender to win the award. Then Virgil got back on the pitch and it was business as usual with 11 clearances and 12/14 aerial duals won.

RM- Richarlison- He has had a bit of a slow start to the season, but on Sunday he sparked into life with 2 goals vs Wolves in what was a exhilarating game which ended in a 3-2 win for the Toffees

CM- Kevin De Bruyne- What a start its been for De Bruyne to this season. He has been the brightest spark in City's midfield and the game at the Etihad was no different as he registered another assist along with his first goal of the season goal and was key to City team that ran riot over Brighton. De Bruyne is back to his absolute best after what was a difficult season and has proved himself the best playmaker in the league with 5 assists and 16 key passes, leading in both stats.

CM- Matteo Guendouzi- Big game for Arsenal but the 20 year old showed no fear and was (in my opinion) Arsenal's best player. He was always looking to get the ball forward which is shown by his 83% pass rate and 2 key passes, with one being a world class cross to assist Aubameyang for the equaliser. He was also very good on defense, winning 3 tackles and making to interceptions. His amazing performance was almost capped off with a goal which would've put the icing on the cake, but was denied by Lloris.

LM- Callum Robinson- The Blades were underdogs going to Stamford Bridge and found themselves 2-0 down at half-time and something had to change, and something did. As soon as the second half started the Blades were away and Robinson scored a well taken goal and continued to have a good game threatening Chelsea a lot having 3 other shots, 2 inside the box, and eventually assisted the equaliser to Zouma for an own goal to salvage a point for the Blades.

ST- Jamie Vardy- Scoring worldies, deadly runs in behind, aggressive closing down, this very much looked like the Jamie Vardy of 2015-16. Brendan Rodgers has breathed new life into this man as he has scored 12 goals in the14 games Rodgers has taken charge of at Leicester. Vardy opened his account with an absolutely sensational chip over the keeper. He later went on to get an assist and another goal to cap off an amazing game

ST- Sergio Aguero- A regular on the Man city scoresheet. Augero showed us once again why he is one of the greatest forwards in the world with 2 magnificent finishes as he dazzled the fans in attendance and gave the Brighton players a torrid time.

241,r/PremierLeague,ncrooks11,3 Words to Sum-Up the Top Six after GW 4,"**Manchester City - Clinical and Rolling -** Birghton &amp; Hove Albion have shown the rest of the Premier League exactly how NOT to play against City. City absolutely pulled apart BHA's attacking style of play and was able to create space and finish their opportunities with great accuracy. Aguero is hitting his stride and Kevin De Bruyne has come roaring back from injury. City's next five fixtures are all winnable, with only Everton away that looks somewhat competitive. City will look to stay on pace with Liverpool and further separate themselves from the rest of the Premier League.

**Liverpool - Finally a Shutout -** Liverpool have finally managed to tally their first clean sheet of the 2019-20 Premier League season against a Burnley side with an inform Ashley Barnes up top. Adrian made a few great saves to keep the clean sheet intact and the rampant attack of Liverpool did their job expertly. A few people will look to much into Sadio Mane's tantrum when coming off the pitch, but this just shows how much of a competitor he is. Liverpool have Leicester, Chelsea, and Manchester United in their next 5 games and will need solid defensive performances to keep pace with City.

**Tottenham - Lack of Composure -** Looking for a rare win away at the Emirates, Tottenham was 2-0 up with only 5 minutes to go until half-time. A scrappy goal from Lacazette followed from what was some perplexing defensive decision making by Danny Rose, sent Spurs into the half-time break up 2-1. All momentum was lost after that and Arsenal came out with serious pressure in the second half. After conceding the equalizer to Aubameyang, Spurs almost lost the game on three consecutive goals until what would be the game winner from Sokratis was deemed offside by VAR. Tottenham also had their own chances to win the game late, Sissoko skewed his opportunity and Kane had a penalty shout that was unanswered by Martin Atkinson. 

**Manchester United - How Much Longer? -** An absolute stunner of a goal from Daniel James gave United the lead at St. Mary's after just 10 minutes. After that though, United looked devoid of any attacking threat and eventually gave up the equalizer in the 58th minute to Jannik Vestergaard. This 1-1 result begs the question, how much longer will this go on for United? With one win in four games played, what changes have to be made to get this team to score more goals? Outside of their dominating performance against Chelsea, they've only managed 1 goal in each of their last three games. Time to move Pogba further forward and give him a free role? Man United fans, let me know what needs to change in the comments!

**Arsenal - Well Fought Match -** After going 2-0 down to Tottenham at home, Arsenal fought back well and put tremendous pressure on Spurs in the second half. The front three of Lacazette, Pepe, and Aubameyang look frightening and will win games by themselves this season. Until the substitution to bring on Ceballos for Torreira, the Arsenal midfield looked invisible and was often bypassed by the Tottenham attack. Granit Xhaka had an absolute blinder of a performance and gunners had to be shaking their heads in dismay when he gave the penalty away for Spurs second goal. All in all it was an average performance from Arsenal with good attacking play in some stages but the defensive errors cost them all three points. 

**Chelsea - International Break Welcome -** After two goals from Tammy Abraham in the first have and a 2-0 score at half-time all Chelsea had to do was manage the game and see out the second half. Sheffield United had other ideas and through Callum Robinson and an own goal by Kurt Zouma, the blades were able to steal a point at Stamford Bridge. The international break seems to be coming at a perfect time for Chelsea if they can get N'golo Kante and Antonio Rudiger back on the pitch. It may be time to give youngster, Reece James some playing time ahead of Azpilicueta who has looked poor early in this season. At least Chelsea fans will be happy that they have found their nailed on starter at the forward position in Tammy Abraham.

He simply went for another challenge he couldn’t win and left a big hole in the middle of our defence of which spurs capitalised on.

That said, the Grealish incident yesterday was an absolute abomination and even if the ref was relying on VAR he should have played on and then called it back for a VAR check.

There\'s so many problems that fix one thing but make create another problem. Or don\'t make sense. Or you don\'t know what the VAR are basing their decision on. I can think of a few problems just this week! Firstly, if we are going to have VAR, we may as well use it for dives and tell the refs not to EVER blow for dives so mistakes like the one against Aston Villa this week don\'t happen. Second, the VAR refs have gone over the top with the interpretation of ""clear and obvious"" mistake. There was a CLEAR pen on Haller in the West Ham vs Crystal Palace game and they reviewed it and didn\'t give it. I have no idea why they didn\'t but I assume it wasn\'t ""clear and obvious"" enough. Absolute grongos. the guy slid in, missed the ball and took out his knee. They need to scrap the clear and obvious thing for sure and just make a new decision everytime VAR is involved. Nothing is worse than watching VAR have a look at something and then the decision being ""yeah um we are not sure just go with what the ref said"" or ""it\'s not enough of an obvious error"".  Just make a new and final decision you weak dogs. Don\'t even get me started on handballs my god. or the offside ""if it\'s close just let em run"" rule. Rashford was pretty obviously offside from a long ball this week and they let him run then he won a corner.

Personally, a fan of  American Football and Baseball, I think that replays take away from the human element of referees. An umpire in baseball will often get a close call wrong because that's all he can determine. And an NFL referee uses his best judgement on when and when not to throw a flag on a play. You're not going to get every call going your way and the video referee corrupts that idea that humans have to make the on field judgement. Not to mention it slows down the game way too much.""]"

The referee today was abysmal. Palace 100% deserved the 3 points, they were the better team.  But I’m assuming that you’ve all seen what happened in the last minute.

Grealish sprints with the ball towards the box and at the VERY worst, falls over. He doesn’t look towards the ref, he doesn’t shout, he even managed to offload the ball to Lansbury before falling over. Lansbury then scores but the ref disallows it and gives Grealish a yellow for diving.

Who do you think will get that position? Personally I’m going West Ham being a hammer myself, but here is an opinion on the big 4 destined to fight for that spot.

Everton - quality side, always making some big signings but can never seem to get it together. Andre Gomes dropped an awful performance against Villa, and Pickford has shown to be a liability at times.

Wolves - A tough unit and turn up against the big teams, but squad depth will be a problem this season; they are going to stay in Europa for longer as they cannot guarantee when they will be in the competition again so they might aswell go for it!

Leicester - Arguably the best midfield outside of the top 6, plus Vardy banging them in are a real threat. However they may struggle since losing Maguire.

West Ham - Have a lot of quality players in Lanzini, Haller and Rice etc, but the midfield is often left exposed and the defence is often not in sync.",self.PremierLeague,Discussion,1567207832.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/cxii67/who_gets_7th_place_this_season/,/r/PremierLeague/comments/cxii67/who_gets_7th_place_this_season/,24,3,3,"['Manchester United', 'I’m going Leicester because Everton don’t seem good enough so far this season, West Ham have a defensive problem and wolves have Europa League which will be prioritised', 'Sorry I’m just throwing this but (Not a fan of any of the top clubs) \n\n1st- Man City / Liverpool \n2nd - Liverpool / Man City \n3rd- Arsenal \n4th- Spurs \n5th - Wolves / Leicester \n6th- Leicester / Wolves\n7th- Everton / West Ham \n8th- Manchester United \n9th - Chelsea', 'Chelsea 100%', 'How about Watford?']"
270,r/PremierLeague,huamanticacacaca,The Internet Predicts The Premier League,"Before the start of the season I invited Redditors and members of a few forums to predict the final 2019/20 Premier League table. Everyone was asked to submit their individual responses and the average position for each team would be calculated. This final calculated table would be viewed as what the internet predicts the final table will look like.    
    
All of the predictions were submitted before a ball was even kicked, and submissions were closed just minutes before kick-off of the first game of the season, when Liverpool beat Norwich 4-1 on Friday 9th August.    

Well the time has come to post the results, albeit a little later than originally planned.  I’ll post the full table below but I thought I’d do a quick summary of what the internet expects of the coming season.    
    
Man City will win the league.    
Liverpool, Tottenham and Arsenal will all quality for next seasons’ Champions League.    
Man United and Chelsea will finish off the top six.    
Bad news for Sheffield United who will finish bottom of the league.    
Norwich and Newcastle will be the other two teams relegated.    
The other newly-promoted team, Aston Villa, will survive the drop and finish 16th.
    
As for the table, I’ve also included the overall “score” for each team, which reflects where they were ranked for all 720 submissions. The easiest way to understand the point scoring being used is that the team ranked in first on an individual table was awarded 20 points, with the team in second being awarded 19 points, 3rd getting 18, and so on until the team ranked 20th was awarded just 1 point. Add up all the points earned by all twenty teams, according to all 720 entries, and we’re left with an overall score. This is how the final positions have been calculated.    
    
Position | Team | Score
:--: | :-- | :--:
01 | Man City | 14025
02 | Liverpool | 13654
03 | Tottenham | 12547
04 | Arsenal | 11576
05 | Man Utd | 11444
06 | Chelsea | 11033
07 | Leicester | 9365
08 | Everton | 9104
09 | Wolves | 8711
10 | West Ham | 7225
11 | Watford | 6690
12 | Bournemouth | 6268
13 | Crystal Palace | 5189
14 | Southampton | 4887
15 | Burnley | 4603
16 | Aston Villa | 3754
17 | Brighton | 2778
18 | Newcastle | 2520
19 | Norwich | 2494
20 | Sheffield Utd | 1863
    
Throughout the season I’ll post updates on how the predicted table is performing compared to the actual table, if people are interested.

290,r/PremierLeague,ncrooks11,3 Words to Sum-Up the Top Six after GW 3,"**Manchester City - New Win Streak -** After stumbling at home to Tottenham last weekend (much thanks to VAR), City are back to their winning ways behind two goals from Sergio Aguero. With a favorable schedule through much of September and October, they will look to reclaim and surpass their past winning streak. 

**Liverpool - Perfect on Top -** This Liverpool squad is on a mission to prove that they are the Premier League favorites, City be damned. Right now, I would not want to be in the shoes of any opposition that stands in front of them, but the Liverpool faithful will still question why this team cannot keep a clean sheet after allowing Arsenal to score in the 85th minute. 

**Tottenham - Not Good Enough -** Spurs have won only 4 games in their last 15 in the Premier League and there are a lot of questions being asked of the North London club. What is going on with Jan Vertonghen? Is Eriksen leaving or staying? Why can this team not keep a clean sheet? Next weekend is the North London Derby and could be a pivotal moment in how Tottenham's season plays out. 

**Manchester United - Ole's Seat Warming? -** When Daniel James scored for United in the 89th minute the momentum looked to have shifted in their favor and you could sense they could possibly score a second and win the game. Crystal Palace and Patrick Van Aanholt had a different idea. United have won just 3 of their last 15 games under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and his seat seems to be heating up at Old Trafford. Also, can anyone score a penalty for United? 

**Chelsea - Lampard's First Win -** Chelsea's first win of the season comes off the back of a Tammy Abraham brace and Frank Lampard will be happy to see his first win as manager. What Lampard won't be happy about is that his defense looks in disarray without N'Golo Kante in the squad. His fitness is crucial to Chelsea's Premier League and Champions League push! 

**Arsenal - Defense Still Lacking -** Arsenal fans thought that their issues at the back had been solved when they brought in David Luiz, or at least they had hoped they had been solved. As it looks after the Liverpool defeat, Luiz is a like for like replacement for Shkodran Mustafi. Although not entirely at fault for their defensive woes, Luiz did not do himself any favors. He needlessly tugged Salah's jersey leading to the penalty and then jumped out of the way of Salah, as Luiz was on a yellow, during his run for the third goal.

Man City - Seattle Seahawks, A team who no one took seriously before but then money &amp; elite players came &amp; they became one of the best in the league. 



Liverpool - San Francisco 49ers, Lots of history &amp; titles but have lacked recent success. Had some of the best players in history &amp; a very big fanbase. 



Spurs - New York Jets, The annoying team who no one likes from the big city who always are misfiring screwups. 



Aston Villa - Cincinati Bengals, Pessimistic team from the middle of the country who haven't really done a whole lot but are always kinda there. 



Newcastle United - Chicago Bears, Unlucky team from up north who are dysfunctional but have really passionate fans. 


Chelsea - New England Patriots, Great teams who got blessed with good owners &amp; great coaches &amp; players for the past two decades &amp; have never stopped winning. Really awful fans.

I think that's open to interpretation. I have seen players running backwards, lose their footing and trip over a player and penalised them because it's on them to keep their footing. Likewise, if a player runs at an opponent in muddy conditions, can't stop and loses their footing - that's on them. Sometimes things happen. Take a stride funny and it puts pressure on your knee and you can't maintain your balance, things like that. Is that what happened here? If so, does that constitute careless? I honestly can't decide on what the right decision is here, I think it's a tough one - and being so ambiguous, VAR can't do much either way. Of course if you don't give the defender the benefit of the doubt then you're saying this was somehow intentional - I couldn't really argue that, but now we have a RC-DOGSO scenario."", 'It felt like Kane didn’t seek the ball, but the player who fell. (don’t know his name) Thus he would have been able to get the ball if he had gone more right.', 'For me it looked like he was going to put some weight on lascelles but as lascelles had gone down he didn’t put weight in anything therefore going down on his own accord', '#Go cry over there 💩 👉 🚮', ""It was a great match. I think the VAR made the right decision, not cause it wasn't penalty, it was penalty, but before the VAR those penalties where hardly ever sanctioned. I think they learn for those millimeter off sides etc. that the general public didnt like their decisions and now they only sanction if it's real clear and the ref didnt see it. I like the VAR more like they did this week than the first. Making calls only on grosse staff.""]"
299,r/PremierLeague,Glami967,United and Solskjaer getting a lot of hate for no reason,"I find it really funny how most people say that Lampard is a great coach and Solskjaer is trash.

Both Chelsea and United have 4 points, but for some reason United and Solskjaer are getting hated and Chelsea is being praised as if they had 9 points. I watched all 3 United games (Yes, I am a United fan, but I am really critical) and they played really well, and had controll of the game against wolves and against crystal, ofc there were some bad aspects of United's game, e.g Lingard and effectiveness, but they don't deserve so much hate. Their game looks much better than last season and they just lack a bit of luck. If Pogba and Rashford scored penalties, I am sure United would have 7 or 9 points.

What is more Lampard and Solskjaer both have really young squads, but again it is Lampard being praised for this and not Solskjaer",self.PremierLeague,Discussion,1566773654.0,,{},https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/cv9gbv/united_and_solskjaer_getting_a_lot_of_hate_for_no/,/r/PremierLeague/comments/cv9gbv/united_and_solskjaer_getting_a_lot_of_hate_for_no/,17,2,2,"[""Do we need a reason to hate ManU? Of course not. Don't be ridiculous."", 'Chelsea spent 40 mil this summer and united spent 150 mil.  Stop being so biased and ignoring facts when it suits you.', 'People love to hate United', 'Imo, I think most people are criticizing Ed Woodward more than Solskjaer. He failed to buy a forward or midfielder and is unable to offload Sanchez yet. \n\nPlus, it’s not just about the 3 games. [United have won 3/15 games in all competitions since the PSG game back in March.  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/cuziye/manchester_united_have_won_315_games_in_all/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) Ole has had more time than Lampard and isn’t under a transfer ban, but doesn’t seem to be improving the team much. He doesn’t deserve the hate he is getting, but I don’t think he deserves praise either\n\nGranted, Lampard isn’t much better than Ole. He only has a year of coaching experience and hasn’t started the season perfectly. But, I think it’s pretty clear that the Chelsea squad is slowly improving. He has transitioned Tammy and Mount into the first team seamlessly. Even in the game against United, Chelsea were creating a lot of chances and looked the better team until the first goal. Once injured players are back to full fitness (Kante, Rüdiger, CHO, RLC, James), the team will be much better.', 'Does anyone actually think Ole has a brighter future as a manager than Lampard?\n\nWinning 4-0 on the opening weekend papered over so many flaws in the team that Ole cannot fix.', ""1.  I didn't say that someone who replied to me did.  2.  It's a fair point because it means chelsea don't actually have anything in their squad that wasn't their last year.  Quite honestly if Chelsea weren't under a transfer ban I don't think they would have signed kovacic he didn't exactly have a great season with them last year. Also its factual.""]"
